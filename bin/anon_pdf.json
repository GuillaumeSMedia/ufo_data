On the evening of 12 April 1954, KA states he was ordered to report to the flight line as there was a crash in the desert; his crew was “Rescue 4.” The crash retrieval was 25-30 miles northwest over a lake where they saw a metallic saucer crashed edgewise into the sand with a dome in the center, and the outer rim was still spinning and the outer edge lights were still rotating in that direction. Several small bodies were scattered outside the craft, motionless and appeared dead; 4-4.5 feet tall with large heads, in tight fitting dark blue uniforms, no helmets.\n\nKA states a ground crew in fatigues was already there and prevented them from getting closer, and began tagging the objects and the bodies. More dead bodies were inside a small hatchway in the crashed disc. The UAP occupants had tried to crawl out on their hands and knees. After KA returned to Roswell he was debriefed for three days in “living hell” in Building No. 5, and told by men dressed in civilian clothes wearing black ties identifying as “intelligence officers” not to speak about the incident, and reading KA a law that referred to fine, imprisonment with hard labor and general discharge if he told anyone about the incident.\n\nKA states he heard the saucer was taken on base and put in Hangar 18, which was expanded over the next two weeks with refrigeration equipment and sophisticated computers. KA heard a rumor at that time another UAP crashed near Bandelier, NM on 24 April 1954. KA states he was sent back to Sampson AFB where his superior accused him of going AWOL and punished him, to which KA told his superior about the UAP crash and his superior did not believe him. KA had a nervous breakdown and was placed in hospital for three months. During the stay, he was injected with a needle where he felt drunk and taken to a room with 4-5 people where he was asked questions about the crash recovery in New Mexico.\n\nOn the day he was released from hospital, KA states he was taken to the base commander’s office and met a Col., who discharged him on 7 March 1955 because he told the Sgt. (superior) about the CR in the desert. KA states that in the years after he was discharged he began having nightmares and needed to talk about the experience, to which Leonard Stringfield listened and believed him.\n\nKA tells Stringfield at the CR, a second chopper landed with four men wearing white pants and long white coats, to which KA tried to photograph them but he was told “don’t take a picture of me, just take what you were told to take.” KA states he saw a silver aluminum colored metallic box on the ground 3 feet long and 1 1/2 feet high with numbers printed on it, there were words too that were indistinguishable; he tried to photograph the box but was told by the ground crew to “get the hell away from that.” The ground crew wore green fatigues with no insignia or rank identity.\n\nKA states later he was told by a stranger in a neighborhood drugstore that he should not talk about his part in the neighborhood drug store and he was called and warned of consequences following a phone call he made in January 1982.\n\n*   [https://www.earthfiles.com/2005/03/03/part-2-ufo-crashretrievals-status-report-iii-amassing-the-evidence/](https://www.earthfiles.com/2005/03/03/part-2-ufo-crashretrievals-status-report-iii-amassing-the-evidence/)\n*   [https://www.earthfiles.com/2005/03/07/part-3-ufo-crashretrievals-status-report-iii-amassing-the-evidence/](https://www.earthfiles.com/2005/03/07/part-3-ufo-crashretrievals-status-report-iii-amassing-the-evidence/)\n",

Scientists in the project tell Talbert they expect to discover anti-gravity within years to a quarter of a century at most; corporate IPP partners include Glenn L. Martin Co., Convair, Bell Aircraft, the Sikorsky Division of United Aircraft, Lear Inc., Clarke Electronics, the Sperry Gyroscope Division of Sperry-Rand Corp., and General Dynamics Corp.\n\nAmong the IPP participants mentioned are: Bryce S.

Belvoir, WPAFB, Andrews AFB and MacDill AFB that a diplomatic visit to Kathmandu was a “fishing expedition” for info on “space objects.”\n\nAnother cable shows the Royal Nepali Army showed photos of four space objects to U.S. officials, and Nepal’s defense secretary asked the U.S. if it had determined the origin of one object.

If true, this contradicts findings of **Blue Book** delivered to Congress and the American people stating a lack of physical evidence was a key reason why UAP were not worthy of future study.\n\n*   [https://web.archive.org/web/20150703123417/http:/www.presidentialufo.com/old_site/marcia_smith_story.htm](https://web.archive.org/web/20150703123417/http:/www.presidentialufo.com/old_site/marcia_smith_story.htm)\n\n\n",

Hours later, Woods and his team partner responded to an penetration alarm on the outer zone of the site, witnessed the UAP at a distance and again directly over the site. It was a red-orange sphere “constantly swirling and churning.”\n\nWoods next states they looked at the object, he felt like he couldn’t breath and looked at his colleague who had a blank stare on his face; he too could not breath. Woods flashed a flashlight at the object and the pressure went away. He next states he sees “something like shadows” outside the vehicle and hears voices in his head “Do not fear” repeatedly. He next sees five or six “small figures” walking toward the vehicle before passing out.\n\nWoods regains consciousness at dawn, after four hours have passed, and he, his team partner and their truck are near Newell Lake, miles from the site. They are found and recovered by Ellsworth personnel and debriefed by AFOSI. Woods was ordered to take a urinalysis and skin samples. Woods states he has two small puncture marks on his skin under his left armpit and above his ankle, and he often has “strange dreams of that night…every time, as something was about to happen or show itself, a great dread came over me. I would awake in a pool of sweat and afraid.” It is unclear if Congress has been made aware of possible abductions of USG personnel and certain the American people have not been made aware of this possibility.\n\n*   [https://www.ufohastings.com/index.php/articles/former-usaf-missile-security-policeman-tells-of-apparent-ufo-abduction-at-icbm-site](https://www.ufohastings.com/index.php/articles/former-usaf-missile-security-policeman-tells-of-apparent-ufo-abduction-at-icbm-site)\n\n\n",

James Doolittle went to Sweden to inspect a saucer that crashed in Spitsbergen in 1946; in 1947, Truman established MJ-12; in the late 40s there was more saucer crashes in Roswell, Aztec and Laredo, TX; one saucer that\ncrashed in the 1950s was so large that logistical problems prevented it from being transported and it was buried; the logistics stories are “legendary” and include moving only at night, purchasing whole farms, cutting down forests, blocking major highways, driving 2-3 trucks in tandem, etc.\n\nHe also claims on 30 April 1964, the first communication between aliens and the USG took place at Holloman AFB; they made a “deal” in exchange for technology the USG would ignore abductions and the EBEs told them abductions were merely monitoring; in fact, abductions were the insertion of implants, implementation of posthypnotic suggestion, termination of some people so they could be biological material, termination of people who are a threat, genetic experiments and impregnation; he claims in 1979 there was an altercation at the Dulce laboratory; by the 1980s, MJ-12 was concerned the mistake they made dealing with the EBEs and began to promote positive film projects like Close Encounters and ET; some of MJ-12 meeting at the “Country Club” wanted to confess the scheme, the other majority chose to develop anti-UAP weapons under cover of SDI.\n\n*   [https://cdn.preterhuman.net/texts/alien.ufo/UFOBBS/1000/1953.ufo](https://cdn.preterhuman.net/texts/alien.ufo/UFOBBS/1000/1953.ufo)\n*   [https://archive.org/details/john-lear-statement-1987](https://archive.org/details/john-lear-statement-1987) (rg - alt URL of his Dec. 29, 1987 statement)\n\n\n",

The bodies were light brown, and the researchers came to the conclusion because there were no deterioration, to leave them alone because another craft might come and rejuvenate/reactivate them. The craft had no seams, no rivets, no welding with a dome at the top.\n\nThe other scientists told him it was made of a material they “never dreamed could exist,” and they had not figured out how to cut a hole in it.

Personnel from the JRDB, MIT, Brookhaven National Laboratory, RAND Corporation, NACA and the Rockefeller Institute also played “major roles” following the 1947 crashes, Kissner stated. He adds that Project Supremacy could have been UAP related, specifically the triangulated radar sites set up in New Mexico in late 1947; he states the 4062nd AISS group was at all three sites and responsible for UAP data collection per AFR 200-2.\n\nKissner added his sources told him the custody of the flying discs was given to the AEC and its national laboratories by classified Presidential Executive Order in July 1948, with the National Security Council (NSC) serving as overall program coordinator with support from Air Force Systems Command, the Naval Research Laboratory, and the Research and Development Board. Kissner unfortunately did not reveal his sources, which were never vetted. In 1974, the AEC was reorganized into the Energy Research and Development Administration and in 1977, the ERDA was reorganized as part of the Department of Energy (DOE). One year after Kissner’s allegations, the DOE told the GAO it could find no records from 1947 related to UAP crashes.\n\n*   _2nd Annual UFO Crash Retrieval Conference Proceedings_, November 12-14, 2004 Las Vegas, Nevada\n\n>**_Note_**: On 29 January 1947, Secretary of War Robert P.

It is worth determining if these facilities were ever utilized for UAP research as well, like Kissner suggests, and if elements of UAP research are controlled by AFSP/AEC/ERDA/DOE legacy classification mechanisms.\n\n>**_Note_**: It is worth determining if there are provisions in the Department of Energy Organization Act of 1977 or thereafter that allow DOE agencies such as the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) or others to retrieve material from other federal agencies or military branches and store it in NNSA or DOE owned laboratory facilities including but not limited to Sandia National Laboratories, Los Alamos, Nevada National Security Site, etc.\n\n\n",

      "desc": "Author Nick Redfern claims a source who was put into contact with him from AFOSI states a group of current and former IC personnel who believed UAP were demonic in origin called the “Collins Elite” published a lengthy document summarizing their beliefs. The report is not published but extracts are; they state the following: “STAC Reports (I to XI) describe the fall, collection, analysis and present whereabouts of unusual fabrics, foils, parchments, chemical residuals and biological material found at found locations in Lincoln County, New Mexico between 3 and 13 July 1947.”\n\nThe report mentions the Collins Elite met at the Loftus Boat on 23 May 1997 and that the Collins Elite was unable to convince CIA S&T at “PTC” of viability of sharing with the Collis Elite the “completed NORTH files on NM discoveries of 1947…S&T at PTC are aware of our briefing from STAC on their files but are reluctant to share NORTH material due to security issues that developed from the Nebraska debacle.”\n\n>**_Note_**: The “Nebraska debacle” may refer to the 25 November 1991 entry where two scientists connected with the the DIA and NSA allegedly claim in a face to face meeting in Nebraska that USG/USG contractors are engaged in programs that attempt to control non-human intelligences (NHI) and harness those NHI for military and intelligence purposes.\n\n“STAC remain committed to advancement to media and population of both Mogul and extra-terra scenarios for NM fallings and discoveries and are troubled by Collins Elite wishing to advance THE THEORY to media and population. This writer privately engaged STAC Markale in conversation on 17 June 1997 and provided him with an amended copy of New Mexico Origins: Parsons, Hubbard and Babalon Working. Markale remains convinced that if placed into public forum knowledge of THE THEORY will irreversibly and negatively affect global social order.”\n\n“This writer privately explained to Markale that Collins Elite initiatives prepared ot ensure a reasonably acceptable transition of the perceived true nature of the Lincoln County discoveries to public and media, as well as a reasonable long-term acceptance of THE THEORY can still proceed with limited social disorder if handled correctly. Markale is not convinced and speaks for the STAC membership.\n\nPresently STAC-5 is privately sympathetic to the position of Collins Elite; he reiterates the position of CANDLE on 4 May 1991 that STAC is now “in too deep” with its attempts to reverse-control the situation and prevent enemy infiltration and deception beyond present levels.”\n\n“This writer sees that disagreement on our part with STAC is unlikely to inflame situation beyond present levels due to STAC’s genuine sympathy with difficulties created for everyone by recent developments. STAC-5 informs this writer STAC totally rejects notion that Collins Elite’s Learning the Way paper that theorizes radically indoctrinating population with belief and faith — and revelation to media and population of true nature of Lincoln County discoveries — can halt enemy infiltration.”\n\n“This writer remains greatly troubled by STAC decision to continue its relationship with contractors Jamison and Wylie who — according to STAC-5 — are still convinced that the “PARSONS TECHNIQUE” can assist in holding off the deception, infiltration and final invasion. This writer adheres to Collins Elite conclusion based on a reading of the original STAC Reports (I to XI) that any attempt to follow the path of Parsons will only result in a catastrophe of the type warned about in Parsons, von Karman and Goddard: A Door Unlocked.”\n\n“STAC-5 understands this but consistently feels the need to reiterate that situation has gone too far for STAC to back down. STAC-5 also informs that WPAFB sources have had some success using the “PARSONS TECHNIQUE” in achieving spontaneous brief laboratory manifestation of materials very similar to two of those that “fell” at Lincoln County, NM in 1947. STAC-5 is of opinion that if long-term manifestation and stability of materials can be achieved and precise originating point of materials can be determined then this will assist NASA-TZER mission to answer the critical questions posed in our 1991 briefing to STAC, _Entry Points — And How Do We Keep Them Closed?_ ”\n\n“Until final outcome of STAC, NASA-TZER and WPAFB research in this area is known this writer recommends that Collins Elite continues to focus attention on planned disclosure to public of THE THEORY if STAC, NASA-TZER and WPAFB attempts to “close the door” are not satisfactory. This writer concludes that if this hypothetical stage is reached disclosure and intense indoctrination of faith and values at planetary level to radically and rapidly alter current population mindset is the only alternative that may prove successful in thwarting plans of enemy.”\n\n“This writer considers the disclosure to media and population of the Lincoln County fabrics, foils, parchments, chemical residuals and biological material to be crucial and integral in terms of revealing the “Trojan Horse” aspect of THE THEORY. STAC-5 understands this too and agrees that only if present attempts by NASA-TZER and WPAFB-1T to prevent widespread infiltration and enemy deception fail that revelation, explanation of the “Trojan Horse” aspect of the Lincoln County fallings and indoctrination may be only viable alternatives.”\n\n“This writer is encouraged by confident comments from STAC-5 that if present and near-future operations fail to achieve success STAC and Collins Elite would provide a united front that would allow THE THEORY to be presented publicly and quickly and in a way that was acceptable to STAC. For that reason and likelihood that enemy infiltration will not be thwarted by STAC and NASA-TZER methods \\[deleted\\] has prepared a unique briefing paper on the Lincoln County Trojans in the event that immediate and emergency dissemination of facts to media and population is required.”\n\n\n",

He claims the original MJ-12 was a consolidation of two Pentagon projects **Majestic** and **Jehovah** overseen by a group of twelve institutions within military, intelligence and science; the highest classification as of the letter was termed SACRED, a follow-on to terms TRINE and UMBRA, he claims.\n\nHe states Majestic was a government panel appointed by President Truman to look into extraterrestrial contact and ways of detecting non-terrestrial signals, while Jehovah was a DOD project to back engineer recovered UAP hardware and research the physics of how the craft worked. He states J Robert Oppenheimer was appointed by Vannevar Bush to head Jehovah until the AEC took away his clearance in 1954, and by 1960, the group concluded UAP were a threat to US defenses and could instigate mass paranoia if they gained control of US defenses. In 1960 the source claims Eisenhower approved a joint defense plan written by MJ-12 that in the event the US came under a nuclear attack by the USSR through “EBE deception,” the US would not retaliate with the proposed USAF SIOP.\n\nHe also states in 1969, President Nixon was briefed by MJ-12 on UAP and all aspects of EBE problem since 1947, after which Nixon approved a SCEO that required intelligence community to purge all references to MJ-12 in their UAP files and to destroy documents that could connect MJ-12 to the JFK assassination. Recently, he claims the dilemma for those “in the know” is that extra-materialized entities (EMEs) have complete control over UAP and can appear anywhere as anything at any time; they have even deceived USG communication projects using remote viewing, he claims.\n\nOther projects mentioned by him are a CIA **Project Environment**, which he claims along with **Project Medea** looked at damage caused by EMEs near nuclear facilities. The prevailing belief of the group is based on materials found in connection with an EME/UAP that a “worldwide invasion” is expected to begin by 2030.\n\n*   [https://majesticdocuments.com/pdf/important_memo.pdf](https://majesticdocuments.com/pdf/important_memo.pdf)\n\n\n",

      "desc": "EarthTech and former CIA scientist Hal Puthoff emails former CIA Life Sciences Division analyst Kit Green and his life partner Kristin B Zimmerman about a story published in a UFO magazine by a pseudonym “Greg Halifax” about a UAP crash retrieval personnel member pseudonym “Sedge Masters.”\n\nThe story refers to Masters having participated in a UAP crash retrievals group known as “**Zodiac**,” of which Puthoff states “we have reason to believe the set of stories are only slightly fictionalized versions of a source’s experiences writing up records for the archives at WPAFB.” Puthoff asks Green if he’s ever heard of **Zodiac**, “which is supposed to be the true name,” not MJ-12 or Majestic\n12\\. At the time, Green was the Chief Technology Officer of General Motors Asia Pacific, while Zimmerman was with GM Research and Development in the area of advanced design.\n\nThe Sedge Masters story itself describes the “blackest of American covert operations” that deals directly with UAP, collated from several different sources, and states a UAP management program exists that falls outside of the normal range of program activities and only members of the intelligence community with specific psychological profiles are selected. It states the program was called **Zodiac**, and had different subdivisions corresponding with different zodiacal signs, including Aquarius. It states the CIA had control over **Zodiac** as of the 1980s and between 1947-1980s, **Zodiac** recovered eleven UAP craft of different sizes and quality, some of which included live occupants of Nordic, small hairy, and tall “grey aliens” and short “grey aliens” appearance. Locations of recoveries listed include New Mexico, off the coast of Denmark and the Midwest.\n\nIn the story, an unnamed Col. tells a psychologist that during one crash recovery, a larger UAP “ship” appeared above the crash site and telepathically told the recovery team not to recover the craft. The team then experienced 90 minutes of missing time and were not able to share that information with staff at WPAFB until they were telepathically ‘released’ and able to do so; the psychologist states “the little gray bastards have thought control and empathy projection.” The story also states a file room at WPAFB has over 2 million accounts of UAP sightings by military personnel and US civilians, most of which were never investigated.\n\n*   [https://imgur.com/a/7D5xIGk](https://imgur.com/a/7D5xIGk)\n*   [https://richarddolanmembers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Sedge-Masters.pdf](https://richarddolanmembers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Sedge-Masters.pdf)\n*   [https://ufos-scientificresearch.blogspot.com/2019/06/an-alleged-2001-national-institute-for.html](https://ufos-scientificresearch.blogspot.com/2019/06/an-alleged-2001-national-institute-for.html)\n*   [https://www.johnclarkson.com.au/images/downloads/DrGreen_Article.pdf](https://www.johnclarkson.com.au/images/downloads/DrGreen_Article.pdf)\n\n>**_Note_**: **Zodiac** is described as a project “able to skirt the military chain of command with impunity, spend money earmarked for other projects, and generally do whatever it damn well pleased, all in the name of UFOs and their importance to National Security.”\n\n>**_Note_**: Ufologist Richard Dolan states he was able to figure out who actually wrote the **Zodiac** story, who was behind the pseudonym “Sedge Masters.” Dolan claims it is an attorney from defense contractor TRW, and that they may have actually spent time in Halifax, Canada, or may be from there (Halifax is mentioned as the location of a safehouse in the story). Dolan does not give the name of the TRW attorney he believes wrote the story and disclosed the name “**Zodiac**” for the first time publicly.\n>*   [https://youtu.be/sEFKaa2mI7M?t=1070](https://youtu.be/sEFKaa2mI7M?t=1070)\n\n>**_Note_**: TRW is mentioned again in the diaries of ufologist Jacques Vallée, who states that former CIA analyst Kit Green told him Eric Walker stated live aliens were retrieved, studied and “allowed to blend into” the human population.

McCandlish describes their propulsion matches early concepts by Thomas Townsend Brown using electrogravitics.\n\nMcCandlish states he saw three antigravity saucers in a hanger at Norton Air Force Base allegedly called “Flux Liners.” He also claims Lockheed Martin at one time possessed a flying triangle shaped like a dart that flew with the blunt end forward, found in a crash retrieval operation in East Germany in 1989.\n\n*   [https://youtu.be/4DrcG7VGgQU?t=4408](https://youtu.be/4DrcG7VGgQU?t=4408)\n*   [https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/story?id=98572&page=1](https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/story?id=98572&page=1)\n*   [https://archive.org/details/SecretSpaceProgrammeAndrewJohnson/page/n231/mode/1up](https://archive.org/details/SecretSpaceProgrammeAndrewJohnson/page/n231/mode/1up)\n\n>**_Note_**: Thomas Townsend Brown served on the initial board of governors for U.S. civilian UAP research organization NICAP with Col. Robert B. Emerson, RADM Delmer S. Fahrney, Gen. William E. Kepner and Brig. Gen. Thomas B. Catron among others. While McCandlish states the UAP he saw were based off of Brown’s research, more recent studies by mainstream scientists show no anti-gravity effects and attribute the phenomena to ionic drift. NASA has studied Brown’s claims and found no anti gravitic force. It is unclear if McCandlish, an illustrator, was simply wrong about the reverse engineered craft’s theoretical construct and they do exist, or if he is fabricating the information.\n>*   [http://www.cufos.org/UFOI_and_Selected_Documents/UFOI/067%20OCTOBER%201971.pdf](http://www.cufos.org/UFOI_and_Selected_Documents/UFOI/067%20OCTOBER%201971.pdf)\n>*   [https://www.wired.com/2003/08/pwr-antigravity/](https://www.wired.com/2003/08/pwr-antigravity/)\n>*   [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Townsend_Brown#Legacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Townsend_Brown#Legacy)\n\n\n",

Boeing\nstates this technology could impact space launch systems, artificial gravity on spacecraft, aircraft propulsion and fuelless electricity generation.\n\nGRASP documents also state the work could be engineered into a radical weapon; high-power experiments using an “impulse gravity generator” can produce a beam of “gravity-like” energy that can exert instantaneous force of 1,000g on any object, enough to vaporize it. Boeing GRASP documents state its examination of Podkletnov’s work show a gravity beam laboratory in Russia can already repel objects up to 200 kilometers away, something that could be used as a ballistic missile shield or anti-satellite weapon.\n\nBoeing attempted to work with Podkletnov directly but were not allowed to due to Russian technology transfer controls. BAE Systems and Lockheed Martin also contacted Podkletnov but he stated he would only work in the “white world” as he is anti-military. Boeing documents seen by Jane’s Defense Weekly admit “classified activities in gravity modification may exist.”\n\n*   [https://web.archive.org/web/20020802222642/http://www.janes.com/aerospace/civil/news/jdw/jdw020729_1_n.shtml](https://web.archive.org/web/20020802222642/http://www.janes.com/aerospace/civil/news/jdw/jdw020729_1_n.shtml)\n\n\n",

      "desc": "EarthTech International employee Dr. Eric Davis, author of several **AATIP** products years later, allegedly meets with VADM Thomas R. Wilson in a car outside of EG&G Special Projects in Las Vegas. Davis transcribes the interaction where he was told the following: VADM Wilson found records of a UAP reverse engineering program using technology “not of this Earth,” it was protected by a special agreement between the DOD Special Access Program Oversight Committee (SAPOC)’s Senior Review Group (SRG) and a large defense contractor he would not disclose.\n\nWilson states Gen. Michael Ward tells him to go to a special projects record group in OUSDAT files not belonging to usual SAP, but rather a group of special legacy holdover programs from before SAP restructuring efforts of the early 1990s. Wilson has this confirmed by OUSDAT officer Paul Kaminski, Director of SAPCO Brig. Gen. Mike Kostelnik and SecDef William J. Perry that the special records group exists and is UAP related. It is a special subset of waived carve-out SAPs obfuscated in the records by cover SAPs containing false descriptions. Wilson seemingly narrows down four UAP related SAPs and has these confirmed by Kaminski, Kostelnik and Perry, who tell him he has the correct contractor, only described as an undisclosed aerospace contractor, “one of the top ones in the US with intelligence in its portfolio.” Wilson states Perry wanted an investigation into cost overruns at the programs but was told to drop it by an undisclosed party.\n\nWilson next calls a program manager attached to the records group, who is joined by a security director and a corporate attorney, who are surprised when he discovered their program(s) are actually\nUAP related (Wilson asks them about crashed UFOs and MJ-12). Wilson states they tell him they’re a “watch committee” of sorts, organized after an audit almost blew their cover, and a special agreement was struck between them, the auditor and SAPOC SRG to prevent disclosure in the future.\n\nWilson is invited to a facility, undisclosed, and meets the three individuals in a secure vault and is given a tour of the program He sees a bigot list 1990-1993 that has no Executive Branch, no staffers, no Clinton/Bush administrations, a few recognized names from OUSDAT, one from NSC and another Pentagon SES employee; most names were corporate scientists and engineers. Wilson is told it was not a weapons, intelligence or special ops program, it was a reverse engineering program from “something recovered years ago in the past,” technological hardware, an intact craft they believed could fly through space/water/air/dimensions. The PM next tells Wilson it is likely “not of this Earth, not made by human hands.” He is told the program had very slow progress and there was no collaboration.\n\nWilson next states he meets the SRG twice and asks for formal access to the four SAPs and is denied, and told by a leader in the SRG that if he doesn’t drop the matter, he will get early retirement and lose 1-2 stars. Wilson also states he talks to USDAT Jacques Gansler about the matter, who tells him UFOs are “real,” but alien abductions are not. Gansler also tells Wilson to drop the matter.\n\nAt the end of Davis’ and Wilson’s meeting, the contractor TRW is mentioned in relation to a Hughes Aircraft attorney Jeffrey W. Griffith and a client of his Mary Elizabeth Elliott. No additional context is given. Names not mentioned in the notes but are relevant include others involved in SAPOC or the SRG at the time: Noel Longuemare Jr., John P. White, John J. Hamre, William F. Moore, Richard “Dick” Williams and Gansler. Others involved in SAPOC who may be aware of the special agreement at the time of the SAP restructuring include John Deutch, Walter Slocombe, William A.

The representative tells him he can meet with the “Collins Elite,” a group of current and former intelligence community personnel who believe UAP are demonic in origin. The Collins Elite allegedly believes all UAP are demonic and should not be contacted. Redfern was given this information by a “Richard Duke” and was given “the Collins Report,” which is allegedly a briefing document from the 1980s that lays out the group’s theories.\n\nDuke claims the group established the belief that UAP are interdimensional and demonic when the FBI, AFOSI and other agencies began investigating physicist Jack Parsons for his links to Aleister Crowley and L. Ron Hubbard, and Parsons’ allegiance to the United States. Parsons was a principal founder of the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the Aerojet Engineering Corporation, and led the California branch of the Thelemite Ordo Templi Orientis (OTO) in the 1940s.\n\nDuke claims some in the US IC believed Parsons and his occult practices were responsible for some UAP sightings, alleging occult rituals were responsible for the channeling of specific UAP events or the “opening” of entry points where more UAP would enter afterward. Duke also claims early members of the Collins Elite were asked by some in the CIA Directorate of Plans in 1952 to determine if UAP had demonic origin. Some **Project Blue Book** cases at the time reminded some CIA officials of ghosts, demons, etc. Duke claims members eventually included AFOSI, NSA and CIA, and other agencies.\n\nRedfern states Duke and other sources informed him that CIA and Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI) personnel attempted to contact entities “Affa” and “Ponnar,” but those attempts allegedly failed. Officials were concerned with eschatalogical forecasts discussed in occult circles, but the forecasts never came to fruition. Duke also claims in the late 1960s, the work of Sidney Gottleib in the Technical Services Staff (CIA TSS) and work by Donald Ewen Cameron was taken up by scientists attached to the CIA’s Office of Research and Development, who attempted to harness “demonic powers” for espionage purposes under **Operation Often**.\n\nDuke claims **Operation Often** and Collins Elite personnel used a cover story that they were US Army psychologists working on a project for the University of South Carolina to understand mental trauma in military personnel; the group’s actual goal was to analyze the nightmares of Paul Garratt after a near-death experience. Garratt told Often personnel after seeing a tunnel of bright light, he was taken to a colder place that was never-ending, flat, light blue and filled with naked screaming human beings; above them were hundreds of saucer-like UAP that “pulsed and throbbed” as if they were living and breathing. Garratt claimed he was in turmoil watching this and saw small “balls of light” fly from the bodies of the people into the saucers. Often personnel concluded the NDE suggested saucers might be harvesting human souls and they were demonic in nature.\n\nDuke claims in the 1980s, President Ronald Reagan was briefed on UAP from different perspectives, including the Collins Elite on the demonic UAP theory, the CIA Science and Technology division on the extraterrestrial/genetic agenda theory, and an Air Force psychologist who argued abductions were not real and the result of the human subconscious. Reagan gravitated to the Collins Elite explanation, and funded a deeper investigation into the phenomenon that concluded abductions were a demonic deception.\n\n*   [https://www.amazon.com/EVENTS-Secret-Government-Demonic-Afterlife-ebook/dp/B004URRYPS/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=nick+redfern+final+events&qid=1663897483&sr=8-1](https://www.amazon.com/EVENTS-Secret-Government-Demonic-Afterlife-ebook/dp/B004URRYPS/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=nick+redfern+final+events&qid=1663897483&sr=8-1)\n\n>**_Note_**: An early member of the group was from Collins, NY, which the group then got its name “Collins Elite” from.

Harry Reid petitioned the DoD to confer SAP status to the **AATIP**, but the DoD denied his request.”\n\nHaisch also states: “It is easier to keep a program hidden in a contractor facility than in a government facility…a crash retrieval or some classified continuation of **Project Blue Book** would likely exist as a deep, black industrial-based SAP. A program involving hardware would be considered technology rather than intelligence and most likely fall under the office of the Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics (OUSDAT). Ironically, for such a program, even someone having an intelligence “ticket” at the highest level would not be considered to have a need to know. All of this results in very effective isolation and virtually no one in a position of open civilian governmental\nauthority, being cognizant of this after a time even though at least in principle of the Special Access Program oversight committee, SAPOC, should be cognizant of such a program. I do not know of any fundamentally limiting factors in the potential longevity of a program. The extreme compartmentalization and limited oversight would tend to keep a program in existence, perhaps indefinitely. Political leaders come and go, pandering to the masses for votes in the eyes of many within the military and intelligence communities, and as a result have varying degrees of respect and trust in that world. Deep Black programs can become quite independent of any given administration, and it would certainly be unrealistic to assume that a given president has been briefed on every SAP. A president does not automatically have a need to know. Moreover, Freedom Of Information Act requests cannot penetrate Unacknowledged Special Access Programs.”\n\n*   [https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/x5v4mr/fmr_lockheed_astrophysicist_and_colleague_of/](https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/x5v4mr/fmr_lockheed_astrophysicist_and_colleague_of/)\n\n",

This usually hides (making the audit trail terminate at the shell company) the flow of money going to the third party company that’s running a waived-unacknowledged SAP where a UAP crash retrieval program is hidden.”\n\n*   [https://www.ufojoe.net/senator-harry-reid-lockheed/](https://www.ufojoe.net/senator-harry-reid-lockheed/)\n\n\n",

Sheehan states it was put into a private trust and two partners from Brown Brothers Harriman became the trustees for the stolen gold.\n\nSheehan states when a flying saucer was discovered in New Mexico in 1947, it was brought to Wright Field and the “Anderson Trust” was established with trustees Robert Anderson, Robert Lovett and John Jay McCloy, all senior partners at Brown Brothers Harriman. Sheehan states a USG group, funded by the covert money from Brown Brothers Harriman, took custody of the UAP technology and “brought in major corporations” like Lockheed, Boeing, and others and “swore them to complete secrecy.” This group has since been allegedly trying to monopolize this technology and monopolize the information about the UAP occupants, etc. Sheehan states he does not know if the group has had diplomatic relations with the ET/UTs, but some witnesses he has spoken to tell him the group is engaging non-human entities.\n\n*   [https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/piuok2/attorney_daniel_sheehan_for_lue_elizondo_and/](https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/piuok2/attorney_daniel_sheehan_for_lue_elizondo_and/)\n\n",

Mellon stated on the record “there is no such \\[secret U.S. triangular craft\\] program,” while D’Amato stated he believed triangular UAP were human made. Neither specified if their comments included UAP sighted over British airspace.\n\n\n",

Fugal says in 2015, Puthoff and Green again called him and suggested he buy Skinwalker from Bigelow, so he did.\n\n*   [https://youtu.be/8Bp0weO-hiI](https://youtu.be/8Bp0weO-hiI)\n\n",
