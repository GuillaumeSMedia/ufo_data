He was assassinated a few months after his accession to the throne by the Praetorian Guard. In the last three months of his brief reign, he had coins minted. One of these coins was found in Syria and can be seen in the Federico Eusebio Archaeological Museum in Alba, the Piedmont city where Publius Helvius Pertinax was born. This coin has the remarkable peculiarity of showing what could well be a mysterious flying object. In the Italian ufology magazine *Clypeus*, numismatist Renato Gatto gave the following description: <br/><br/>The Emperor Pertinax \\(...\\) had coins minted not with any star \\(a decorative motif often used to immortalize great events\\) but with a globe surmounted by antennas similar to those of our first artificial satellites. Many experts, after examining these coins, agreed to affirm that the object represented was neither the Sun, nor the Moon, nor any other celestial body. This certainty is based on the fact that the 4 \"rays\" of the globe in question are arranged in a completely different way from that which characterizes the representations of stars. The words *Providentia deorum* engraved on one of the faces of the coin exalt the goodness of the gods. On the other face, one sees a woman personifying *Providentia*, a minor divinity who must have manifested herself at the time of the appearance of the four-rayed globe that Rome wanted to commemorate.<br/><br/>Is it rash to suggest that this antennaed globe could be one of those mysterious flying objects called UFOs? By looking at the photographs of the coin, one sees a woman stretching out her hands towards an enigmatic object above her, a globe from which 4 rays emerge in asymmetrical positions, while the usual representations of a known star are symmetrical. But then, what is the mysterious event commemorated by the coin? The Roman historian of the 5th century Lampridius speaks in his *Life of Commodus* of a bright and quite large object that had crossed the sky during the reign of the tyrant. The excellent Greek historian Herodian \\(170-240\\), considered one of the most reliable of his time and who held public offices in Rome, confirms in his *Notes on the History of the Empire after Marcus Aurelius* \\(book 1\\) that stars were seen suspended in the air in broad daylight at that time and locates the appearance of the event in 189 or 190. It is therefore quite possible that the coin of Emperor Pertinax wanted to account for its appearance.",

At this sight, Antoine, like a good soldier, seized the shield of faith and the helmet of hope: nevertheless, the creature offered him the fruit of the palm tree to sustain him on his journey and as a kind of peace offering. Antoine, seeing this, stopped and asked him who he was. The answer he received was this: \"I am a mortal being and one of the inhabitants of the Desert whom the Gentiles abused by designating him in an erroneous cult of various forms under the names of Fauns, Satyrs and Incubi. I am sent to represent my people. We beg you to solicit for us the favor of your Lord and ours, who, we have learned, once came to save the world, and whose voice has penetrated the whole earth.\" As he uttered these words, tears streamed down the old traveler's cheeks, witnesses of his deep emotion, and which he shed in the fullness of his joy. He rejoiced in the glory of Christ and the destruction of Satan, and marveled at being able to understand the language of the satyr during all this time, and, striking the ground with his staff, he said: \"Woe to you, Alexandria, who, instead of God, have worshiped monsters! Woe to you, city of prostitutes, in which the demons of the whole world rush together. What have you to say now? Beasts that speak of Christ, and you who, instead of God, worship monsters...\" He had not finished speaking when - as if it had wings - the wild creature fled far away. Let no one have any scruple in believing this incident; its truth is affirmed by what happened when Constantine was on the throne, an affair of which the whole world was witness. For a man of this kind was brought alive to Alexandria and shown to the people as a wonderful spectacle. Later, to prevent his corpse from rotting in the heat, it was preserved in salt and taken to Antioch so that the Emperor could see it.",

The moai were carved from the tuff of the island's volcano, *Rano Raraku*. On the other hand, the huge red tuff cylinder that often tops their heads comes from another volcano, Puna Pau.

Shortly after sunset one evening, he saw a brightly lit body in the sky, moving very rapidly eastward. It was perfectly visible for at least 5 seconds, then suddenly split into several parts like the explosion of a rocket in the air. A few minutes later, he heard a loud explosion, which shook the ground very distinctly, followed shortly after by a loud rumbling, as if a tornado were passing through the forest. A strong wind arose at this moment, but subsided just as suddenly. The air was also filled with a peculiar smell, somewhat sulphurous.<br/><br/>The next day he found that about 2 miles from his camp, as far as he could see in every direction, a path had been cut through the forest, several rods wide --- giant trees uprooted or broken off at their base --- the tops of hills shaved off, and the ground plowed in many places. Enormous and extensive ravages are visible everywhere. Following the trace of this desolation, he quickly finds its origin by observing the shape of an immense stone sent onto the side of a mountain. An examination of this stone, or at least of its major visible part, shows that it has been divided into fragments, and that, in various places, it is marked with curious hieroglyphs. Lumley also finds other fragments of a substance resembling glass, and here and there dark spots, as if caused by a liquid. He thinks that the hieroglyphs are made by human hands, and that the stone itself, although a fragment of an immense body, must have been used for some purpose by animated entities.",

      "desc": "\\(Translated from French\\) The *Dei Gratia*, a brigantine, cuts through the waters near the Azores when it encounters a seemingly helpless ship. The sea is calm. It is the British brigantine, the *Mary Celeste*, drifting slowly, all sails out. The *Dei Gratia* sends a boat and some men, who board the ship. The ship is deserted. An uneasiness takes hold of the new arrivals. Laundry is still drying on the deck and, in the cabin, teacups are still arranged, ready to be drunk. In the cabins, a small harmonium is open, with a sheet of music on the music stand. Children's toys are scattered on the floor and, in the captain's office, his gold watch is found. On a cushion, the imprint of a small child's head can be guessed. As no boat is missing, the sailors scan the sea in the hope of seeing a body or a head, floating, but in vain. No other ship was crossing in the area and yet, all these traces of abandonment are recent. Nothing is floating. It seems that the cabins had been abandoned in a hurry, the second of the *Dei Gratia*, Oliver Deveau, who boarded the *Mary Celeste*, would later declare. The crew seems to have acted in panic. The men had indeed left their personal possessions, that is to say that their clothes were still in their place... Nothing is missing, not even their pipes, one of which is still warm and smoking, so dear to any sailor.<br/><br/>The captain was accompanied by his wife and daughter. A half-hemmed skirt is still engaged on the table of a sewing machine. Only the chronometer, the sextant and the logbooks, including the nationality certificate, are missing. Only a cat emits faint meows and it is neither hungry nor scared. The cargo --- 1700 barrels of raw alcohol --- has not been touched. The total value of the boat and its cargo is estimated at around 8500 £. Traces of boarding with something are found on the *Mary Celeste*: grooves from a cutting instrument, *on both sides* and a few feet from the bow, about fifty centimeters above the flotation, are judged to be very recent, and not due to the action of time. A deep cut is also found on the starboard railing. Oliver Deveau declared that he had no idea of the origin of this cut. Near this cut, brown spots are found on the deck, directly above, seeming to have been caused by blood. It is then suspected that Captain Moorehouse, of the *Dei Gratia*, and his crew, had massacred the crew of the brigantine in order to receive the reward for any discovery of a drifting wreck and its contents.<br/><br/>However, the report of the doctor who performed an analysis from the blood spots remained in a sealed envelope and was not revealed until 14 years later \\(which did not prevent the suspects from being prosecuted on mere presumptions\\). The doctor, Doctor Patron, declared to have removed with a pair of scissors several brown red spots, thick 1 mm and about 1 cm in diameter, on the deck and on the railing. After these negative experiments, I feel authorized to conclude that, in the current state of our scientific knowledge, there is no blood, neither in the spots found on the deck of the *Mary Celeste*, nor in those found on the blade of the sword I examined. The origin of these brown red spots is not revealed. A sword is found, covered with the same brown spots. In the bosun's cabin, on his table, there is a slate where the temperature, the time, the notes of the dial were written: November 24th, 11am, 36° north latitude, 27° west longitude, fine weather. A line passed, one can read: Strange, my dear wife.. (November 24th, 11am)",

The brief report that follows, concerning a recent and strange meteorological phenomenon, may interest your readers as a new example to add to the list of electrical eccentricities. During the night of October 24th last, marked by rain and even a storm, a family of 9 people sleeping in a cabin a few kilometers from Maracaibo was awakened by a dull buzzing and a dazzling light that brightly illuminated the inside of the house. Completely terrified and believing --- as they said --- that the end of the world had come, its occupants threw themselves to their knees to pray, but their devotion was almost immediately interrupted by violent nausea, while swellings spread over the upper parts of their body, mainly the face and lips. It should be noted that the bright light was not accompanied by any sensation of heat, although the air was apparently charged with smoke with a particular smell. The next morning, the swellings had decreased, leaving large blackish patches on the face and body. <br/><br/>No particular pain was felt, until the 9th day when, the skin beginning to peel, the pustules transformed into painful raw wounds. Hair fell out on the side that had been directly exposed to the phenomenon, the body being most affected on that side. What is remarkable about this phenomenon is that the house was absolutely intact, all doors and windows being closed at the time of the facts. No trace of lightning was observed in the rest of the dwelling and all the victims declare that there was no detonation, but only this already mentioned low buzzing. Another strange circumstance is that the trees around the house showed no particular sign before the 9th day, the date on which they withered quickly, almost all, while the wounds appeared on the occupants of the house. There may be a coincidence there, but it is still surprising to observe that animal and vegetable organisms react in the same way, and in the same time frame, to electrical effects. <br/><br/>I went to visit the victims in one of the hospitals of this city; although their appearance is really horrible, it is to be hoped that these wounds will not be fatal to them. Signed: Walter Cogwill, Consulate of the United States, Maracaibo, Venezuela, November 7, 1886.<br/><br/>What these 9 people are experiencing resembles strong radiation and is closer to the effects of nuclear power than to the \"mysteries\" of electricity.

It left behind a trail of 8 or 10 m long glowing sparks and reappeared again 6 or 7 days later in front of all the villagers. The object made a whistling sound and appeared \"out of nowhere\" above a particular house 800 m away from where the witness lived, and suddenly disappeared above another residence.

The extraterrestrials were small dwarves, about 0.9 m to 1 m tall, with large hairless pear-shaped heads, slightly dystrophic-looking bodies, long thin hands with 4 fingers, grayish skin and large dark slanted eyes. The Germans fear moving the disc to a more distant location, for fear that it might explode during a long journey during transport. So a research laboratory is built nearby. From Hirschberg the disc is moved to a safer place which, more likely, is called \"Der Riese\", a Nazi complex in the nearby Gory Sowie mountains \\(now in southwestern Poland\\), which is also a site used to extract uranium ore. This complex has an extensive network of underground hangars, connected by tunnels. The bodies of the occupants and the living extraterrestrial are also moved to this complex. The extraterrestrial who lived for a month apparently provided some kind of information to the Germans and desperately asked for the help of the Nazi doctors, but they could not help him due to the different biological structure of his body. The extraterrestrial dies of an unknown illness. The origin of the crashed craft is apparently the double star RA known on Earth as 78 mu-1, Cygni, at 73.1 al away. Among the information given to the Germans by the surviving extraterrestrial is the fact that they have built underground bases in the polar region of the Canadian Territories, perhaps Baffin Island. This data is provided to Hitler himself. But no substantial technical data is actually provided by the extraterrestrial that could help the Nazi scientists to compete with extraterrestrial technology, despite their desperate attempt to obtain this data \\[Robert K Lesniakiewicz, Milos Jesensky *Wunderland, Extraterrestrial Technologies*, Anton Anfalov, Lenura A Azizova, Iryna V Volyk & Sergey V Kovalevskiy\\].

The *Luftwaffe* had occupied the old aerodrome of Le Mans, at the Circuit de la Sarthe, and maintained several groups of *Messerschmitt* 109s, not very fast, but excessively maneuverable. The German pilots were in a permanent state of alert and, several times, I observed from quite close up the take-offs in groups of the *Messerschmitts* in broad daylight. The weather was magnificent, a Sunday as far as I remember, and around 1 PM, the very clear sky contained only a few large cumulus clouds, clouds which were moreover very far apart from each other. Around 1 PM, the whole city heard the roar of the planes taking off in haste and I could see that the cause of the alert seemed to be in one of the large cumulus clouds which, at that moment, was flying very slowly over the aerodrome. One could see the Messerschmitts whirling around like mad around the cloud, diving into it at full speed, coming out in a loop or sideways, and starting their maneuvers again, a spectacle which was truly very pretty, but which must have been terribly dangerous for the pilots. Was it an exercise ordered by the commander of the camp or an alert? I never knew, but it was curious to observe the terrified airs of the German soldiers and officers quartered in the city, who followed the spectacle from the windows of the houses. I could then observe that the cloud which, upon its arrival, seemed to have its base at 300 m and to culminate at 1000 m, began to swell and, when it moved away from the aerodrome to move away from the city, it had taken the shape of a very high pyramid, with perfectly sharp contours and brilliantly lit by the sun; its very sharp peak must have been probably at 3000 m, according to a height visible on the horizon and its probable place on the ground. My observation point was 4 km from the aerodrome and the cloud was approximately 5 km away when I observed its summit. (Beginning of Summer, Sunday, 1 PM)",

A light appears on the horizon, then disappears behind a cloud. Then a second light appears, yellow, apparently a beam shot from the edge of a circular object. The beam, about 30 cm in diameter, oscillates around and then darts on Lancashire's face. The soldier drops his gun and raises his hands. He feels a strange floating sensation and loses consciousness. When he comes to a few minutes later, he lies a few meters from where he had seen the light. He remains shocked and dazed for 5 or 10 minutes before feeling fully recovered and able to resume his watch. In the years following this incident, Lancashire will have a number of strange dreams. In one of them, he will remember having been on board the object he saw, and having observed the sea below from a large window; a man in white told him he had to take him on board the craft. In another dream, Lancashire was still in the device and met a red-haired woman, wearing a skirt that stopped at the calves \\(in fashion in 1942\\) who handed him a pair of glasses. Years later, Lancashire came to think that the best explanation for his 1942 experience was that he had been abducted by extraterrestrials. He only reported the incident from his 70s.",

They leave their cars and run towards the light, which looks like a church bell, with a strange diffuse orange color. When they approach it, they hear a whistling, like air escaping from a compressor. A moment later the object rises 9 to 18 feet above the water, and takes off at an enormous speed, without any sign of acceleration. The object eventually turns a deep blue color before disappearing above the Oslofjorden. At the moment of its disappearance, the 4 witnesses start searching the area and discover a crater-shaped depression in the snow, about 4.5 feet in diameter and about 3 feet deep. Around it the snow has melted, on a diameter of 54 feet. \\[Australian Flying Saucer Review, 7/1968\\] \\[Phillips: Physical traces associated with UFO sightings, 1975, 5\\] \\[Rapportnytt, 4/1979, 4-5.

Followed by a huge smoky trail, the [meteor](https://web.archive.org/web/2005/http://rr0.org/1947.html) streaks towards the Earth, filling the sky with deep reverberating thunderclaps and shaking the ground. The meteorite, estimated to weigh more than 100 tons, explodes into fragments that impact a large area, digging more than 120 craters, the largest of which is 20 feet deep and 90 feet in diameter. Blocks of iron weighing up to 2 tons are scattered across the landscape.

Although it is now known that the meteor traveled from the North-Northeast to the South-Southwest, the Soviet investigator initially dispatched to the scene, Krinov, will indicate a trajectory from the North-Northwest to the South-Southeast.

The boat stops in a bay of Maury Island, about 5 km from Tacoma. People on board the vessel then see 6 very large, doughnut-shaped objects just above their heads. None of these objects make any noise. 5 of the UFOs start to circle the 6th, which loses altitude until it stops, hovering. Afraid that the object might fall into the sea, Dahl moves the boat onto the beach. That's where he takes 4 photographs of the objects. The central UFO then vomits out pieces of molten metal that fall into the water and onto the shore. One of them kills the dog, another severely burns Dahl's son, and a seagull is also killed. The boat is damaged. Then the UFO rises, joins the others, and all 6 of them speed off over the Pacific. The men collect samples of the still-hot metal.

Moreover, it seems that someone has filled Arnold's hotel room with microphones, transmitting to local newspapers the details of his conversations, even those he had alone with Brown and Davidson. He contacts another intelligence officer, a certain Major Sanders, who obstructs him. Arnold, now deeply shaken, leaves town. Official explanation: hoax set up by the coast guard to get publicity. However, they are not prosecuted.",

As the battleship had no radio, the 8 sailors on board could not give their position. In the morning, a cargo ship spotted some light signals that could be distress rockets. Another ship confirmed this observation. The search continued with more intensity, and airplanes reported black shapes in 2 or 3 different places, 35 to 40 km apart. A tugboat also observed a kind of black mass lying on the waves, but it disappeared afterwards. The investigation showed that the battleship had been properly ballasted and it was impossible for it to capsize before the search continued in the afternoon of the 4th. (October 4th)",

[Coral Lorenzen](https://web.archive.org/web/2005/http://rr0.org/LorenzenCoralE.html) has an appointment with a young woman about whom she thinks to write an article for one of the newspapers she works for. She arrives on time but the young woman is not at home and [Lorenzen](https://web.archive.org/web/2005/http://rr0.org/LorenzenCoralE.html) decides to walk a few blocks to a nearby drugstore for a coffee. When she turns onto the main street she notices people standing in the street pointing at the sky. Looking in the designated direction, she sees a silver, elliptical-shaped object to the northeast. The editor-in-chief of the *Door County Advocate* and one of the journalists who are also in the street tell her that the object was described to them in a call from a point further north-east at Potawotami Park. [Lorenzen](https://web.archive.org/web/2005/http://rr0.org/LorenzenCoralE.html) immediately enters the drugstore and calls the local police station, asking if there is a patrol car in the vicinity of Fish Creek. She is told yes and she then asks them to call and ask what they see. Shortly after she gets the answer: at about 60° elevation to the northeast they were looking at an object that was rather round with a silver color. She then goes back out into the street, positioning herself with her back to a certain area of a brick building and aligning the object at the top of a television antenna mast, carefully noting the point from which she was observing and the point where the antenna mast obscured the object. It did not obscure it too much, however, there was a bit of the object visible on either side of the mast, she will later state. Between conversations with the officers at Fish Creek and her own observations she tries several times to reach her husband, who is at home. He does not answer and she will later learn that he had gone out into the orchard to do some pruning. \"I was sick with disappointment,\" Jim Lorenzen will say. \"I had never seen anything in the sky that was so remarkable that I couldn't explain it, so I was disgusted to have missed the opportunity. However, [Coral Lorenzen](https://web.archive.org/web/2005/http://rr0.org/LorenzenCoralE.html) carefully measured the angles during the observation and when she provided the results to her husband, he was able to triangulate: they then estimated that the object, observed for 40 minutes, was at least 40 miles above the Earth and was about 780 feet in diameter, ruling out the explanation of a balloon or other mundane object. A third of the area of the object became a bright red shortly after being observed, giving the appearance, from Sturgeon Bay, of a silver cigar-shaped object with a glowing red base. When it was observed by the policeman 25 miles away in Fish Creek, it was almost circular with a \"opening\" red in the center too bright to be observed with ordinary glasses. (May 21, 7 PM)",

Suddenly, the child tells him she has seen \"something\" in the woods. Her father heads towards the indicated spot. He recounts: Thinking it was a deer, I approached quietly. Suddenly, I stopped, struck with amazement: in front of me, between the trees, stood two beings resembling men, wearing strange metallic suits. They were carefully examining the ground of a small clearing. Close to them stood a metal saucer of impressive size, measuring at least 8 meters in diameter. Its edges were pierced with two rows of openings. Its upper part was dominated by a cylindrical metal tube in a blackish color, shaped like a turret placed in the vertical axis of the craft. Under the effect of surprise, I called my daughter who had stayed near the motorcycle. But upon hearing my voice, the two metal-clad beings rushed towards the craft, entered the cylinder and locked themselves in. One of them had a kind of lamp on his chest that emitted flashes at regular intervals. In a few seconds, the edges of the craft where the openings I had mentioned appeared began to vibrate as if under the effect of an intense inner fire. They took on a green hue, then became vermilion, like metal heated to red. While these phenomena were occurring, I heard a faint humming. I had the impression that the cylindrical tube disappeared while the craft was lifting, which allowed me to observe that this tube extended underneath and served as a support. Taking advantage of this powerful support, the craft continued to rise. It was like a monstrous pink mushroom... When it had reached a certain height, it began to spin at an increasing speed. Then it moved away vibrating and without ceasing to spin like a top. The cylindrical tube had completely disappeared from the underside. The craft's ascent speed increased rapidly. Suddenly, it stopped horizontally and disappeared behind the hill at a dizzying speed. (June 30th)",

A radar and radio contact was maintained with the pilot of the fighter while he was guided towards the UFOs, themselves followed by radar.

The vessel, about 9 m in diameter, appears to be made of aluminum and forms an acute angle with the ground. Following the impact, the object sank 50 cm into the ground. It is guarded by military patrols. Werner is tasked with calculating the impact speed of the object. Inside there are 2 swivel chairs in an ovoid cabin equipped with many instruments. A tent is set up nearby to shelter the remains of the sole occupant. Once his report is submitted, he is taken back in the bus with blackened windows, awaiting departure for Nevada. Just before getting on the bus, he manages to take a quick look inside a tent. That's when he sees a being measuring 1.20 m, whose skin has a brownish appearance, wearing a silver suit and a cap. Signing a declaration keeping him in secrecy, Werner does not believe for a single moment that it is a top-secret American fighter jet - as the army claims. He contacts [Ray Fowler](https://web.archive.org/web/2005/http://rr0.org/FowlerRaymondE.html) in the hope of clarifying this mysterious event. Unfortunately, he proves unable to help him. However, he will publish the declaration under Werner's seal in *Official UFO Magazine,* in April 1976. It will be 4 years later that another ufologist, named [Leonard Stringfield](https://web.archive.org/web/2005/http://rr0.org/StringfieldLeonardH.html), will be able to collect the testimony of a 2nd witness who seems to confirm in all points Werner's version. The witness, a former pilot of the National Guard, explains to [StringField](https://web.archive.org/web/2005/http://rr0.org/StringfieldLeonardH.html) who was, in the 1950s, stationed at the [Wright-Patterson](https://web.archive.org/web/2005/http://rr0.org/WrightPatterson.html) air base in Dayton \\(Ohio\\). It turns out that between 1948 and 1969, this base was jointly the headquarters of a UFO research project set up by the US government, as well as that of the [FTD](https://web.archive.org/web/2005/http://rr0.org/FTD.html). The [FTD](https://web.archive.org/web/2005/http://rr0.org/FTD.html) was tasked with training specialists in the study of enemy technology that fell into the hands of the Americans. Generally, these were Soviet MIG fighters that had crashed on American soil and were likely to provide information on enemy capabilities. But nothing says that this technology did not come from more exotic sources. According to the pilot, it was during the year 1953 that boxes containing debris recovered from the Arizona desert arrived at the [Wright-Patterson](https://web.archive.org/web/2005/http://rr0.org/WrightPatterson.html) base. Inside were the bodies of 3 strange beings --- measuring about 1.20 m tall, with incredibly large heads and skin like parchment. They had been packed in dry ice containers to preserve their tissues. Many other boxes followed, containing various pieces of wreckage. The pilot unfortunately did not have the opportunity to examine their contents, but he nevertheless remembered that some debris bore symbols similar to Sanskrit. (May 21st, evening)",

The officer present estimated that the object must have been at least 50 m in diameter, and that it seemed to be about 10000 m high. To make sure it was not a phenomenon or an optical illusion, it was decided to carry out a complete cleaning of the searchlight. The charcoal was also changed and relit. The object was still there. For 3 hours, the device remained motionless. It looked like a kind of vertical cigar. But since nothing was happening, they finally turned off the searchlight. Commander Cotel, who was in charge of the anti-aircraft detachment, sent a report to the military governor of Metz. \"There is no need to take into account this information in this particular case\". The case was closed. Not a word of the observation made not only by the technicians but also by the visitors, and by the inhabitants of Metz up to the suburbs of Sablon and Queuleu. The object had the shape of a small motionless and regular-shaped cumulus. But its shape, its dimensions and its position remained rigorously identical, moreover the sky was perfectly clear except for this supposed cumulus. Which would rule out the possibility of a cloud. Now, a diameter of 50 m is a lot for a balloon... Strangely enough, the radar had constantly swept the sky during the observation, without catching anything. This could mean two things: either the object was not metallic, or it was out of range of the type of radar that was operating in Metz. (23 h)",

As they were in the suburbs, near a park of the Ministry of Agriculture, Paz asked his friends to stop the car so he could go to a secluded place in the park to relieve himself. Paz had barely taken a dozen steps before he called for help. His friends ran to his rescue and found him unconscious and lying on the ground. At a short distance there was a small, hairy humanoid, running towards a bright device resembling a disk, resting on the grass. Mejia had just enough time to grab a stone and throw it at the disk, which began to rise with a huge rumbling noise. Paz was quickly taken to the city hospital, where the doctors found him in shock. He also had long and deep scratches on his right side and down his spine, like claw marks, the doctor said. Paz told the authorities he had walked around a grove of large flowers, his tracks softened by the thick grass. Suddenly he would have fallen on this small humanoid and hairy creature, which was examining the flowers. Paz tried to escape but, as he turned around, the creature attacked him, first by scratching and pulling his shirt, then with a breath on the neck that knocked out Paz. (December 16th, Night)",

Then, it went up and down for about 30 seconds, and finally disappeared quickly. While it was going up and down, I could see steam or smoke coming out of what looked like round doors or windows at the top of the craft. This craft had the shape of an ordinary bell and was wide enough to carry several planes of the type it had captured. All this happened, so to speak, near me, and I could perfectly see the plane and the craft. The plane was a light bomber fighter, and it was reported missing by St. Louis radio. It was never found. Some time later, a similar craft pursued 3 jet planes. These strange crafts are, without a doubt, the fastest objects I have ever seen. I timed the speed of the planes when the craft was pursuing them: it covered in a few seconds the same distance that the \"Jets\" did in 3 minutes. (March 9, 5:30 PM)",

Extract from the pilot's account: Coming from the West, it was heading towards us. It was in the shape of a saucer. It turned and dove to skirt a low cloud. It did not venture into the low drifting clouds in the sky but remained in the clear areas. When it arrived about 180 m from us, it inclined on its side and then returned to its initial position, parallel to the ground... it stopped about a dozen m above the lake, and about 75 m from us. We detected neither noise nor smell. The thing seemed to me at most 1.20 to 1.50 m wide with a thickness of 20 to 25 cm. It was silver white in color.

Sparks and flames are seen emitted by the object. No openings are seen on the object as it passes over the witnesses' train. The 2 flying discs rise relatively slowly up to 6000 feet, then suddenly increase their speed in horizontal flight towards the North. The disc's altitude remained the same during the ascent \\(?\\) as in cruise, as a disc launched in flight. Two searchlights pointed almost vertically are seen near the takeoff zone about 1-2 miles \\(16-32 km \\(?\\)\\) south of the railway.

To back up his claims, he gave two examples, intentionally omitting names, places and dates. One of them seems to be, with one or two details changed, the Kinross case \\(November 23, 1953\\). For the second one, Edgar Smith's notes indicate: A transport plane with 26 people on board was quickly approaching its base. It was about 16 km from the coast. On the ground, in the radar station, the operator was carefully following the transport plane and maintaining constant radar contact with it. Suddenly, the operator discovered a second trace on his screen. He immediately contacted the transport plane by radio and warned the pilot to be careful of the unidentified object. The UFO was moving at a very high speed, about 4000 km/h. It was jumping on the screen like a tennis ball. Suddenly, the mysterious \"blip\" flew straight to the transport plane's one and, before the operator had time to warn the pilot, the two objects became one on the screen. The remaining trace then disappeared into the sky at a dizzying speed. The search revealed no trace of oil on the surface of the water. Nothing but a general's briefcase floating. The plane had disappeared without a trace. American researcher Jerome Clark has noted that no one, neither Sergeant Hill nor the USAF, had denied Tom Comella's allegations. Moreover, *Fate* is a well-known magazine in the Anglo-Saxon world and the article had specifically named certain people.",

The lower cone is formed of a bundle of luminous, multicolored and parallel tigelles, agitated by a rapid movement, and the noise comes from one of the two road signs at the intersection, which is also vibrating violently, as if there was a resonance between the movement of the tigelles and that of the sign. Frightened, the two women scream and attract the attention of a third person. At the same time, the object, which has descended to the ground level, makes a kind of jump and flies over a second road sign which also starts to vibrate, producing the same metallic noise. Continuing its flight, but in silence, the craft travels about 200 m, approaches the ground, perhaps touching it, stops for a few seconds, makes a second jump, accelerates and disappears towards the Southeast at a moderate speed, raising a whirlwind of dust. It is then noticed that the two signs are abnormally magnetized: compass needle deviated by 15° at 5 cm of distance, while, under the same conditions, a third sign, further away, does not produce any deviation. It is also noticed that a canal irrigation valve located near the second point of approach to the ground is also magnetized. The grass is scorched and trampled at the landing site.

At 10,500 m it was followed by a big and intense white/bluish light: An [Air Force](https://web.archive.org/web/2005/http://rr0.org/USAF.html) RB-47, equipped with electronic countermeasures \\(ECM\\) apparatus, with a crew of 6 officers, was followed by an unidentified object for more than 1200 km for 1 hour and 30 minutes, while it flew over Mississippi, Louisiana, Texas and reached Oklahoma. The object was several times seen directly by the cockpit crew as a very bright light; it was tracked by ground radar and detected by the ECM equipment carried by the plane. The particular interest of this case lies in the simultaneous appearances and disappearances observed by 3 distinct channels and in the speed of the maneuvers that exceeded anything the crew had experienced before. The object thus disappeared from the radar screens several times in a row, to reappear simultaneously following the plane almost all the time at a distance of about 17 km, before quickly changing position to be in front of the plane. Chase momentarily forgot his mission and headed towards the mysterious light that disappeared as he approached. Chase resumed his initial course but the \"target\" reappeared under the Stratojet. The plane dived again towards the UFO which disappeared once again. Out of fuel, the Boeing had to return to its Forbes base. The [Condon Commission](https://web.archive.org/web/2005/http://rr0.org/BlueBook.html\\#Condon) was seized of this case 10 years later, but classified the case for lack of access to the file.

She has no time to think when she suddenly discovers an object that looks like an airplane carcass in the middle of the road: A large shape was visible, and a thin, 15 m high rod, illuminated, which seemed to shorten and sink into the ground. My engine slowed down and, as I approached, my car stopped completely. I was panic-stricken and desperately tried to start it again as I had no lights. My first thought was to get out and see what was going on, when suddenly I saw two shapes standing next to the rod that was getting shorter and shorter. They were suspended but spinning around. It looked like animals with four legs and a tail, but with two antennas under the head, like arms. Before I had time to breathe, the things disappeared and the craft rose into the air; I then realized it was a UFO: it turned and zigzagged about 3 m above the ground, then rose again and I couldn't even see where it went. Suddenly my headlights came back on. I started the engine and everything was fine. I drove to the place, got out my flashlight, and walked to the scene itself. In a large hole about 30 cm wide, where the snow had melted, a little grass was visible. The grass was warm but no depression was observed. (1:30)",

When he looked up, he saw a huge object, about 300 m in diameter, descending to about 45 m from him. The most remarkable thing about this object was not its size but the conical beam of an emerald green light coming from underneath and directed towards the ground. The legionnaire's memories of what followed are quite vague, and, as he himself admits, may not correspond to reality: instead of shooting to alert the others or taking the field telephone to call his superiors, the young man stayed there staring at the object for more than 45 minutes. Questioned by [Joël Mesnard](https://web.archive.org/web/2005/http://rr0.org/MesnardJoel.html), he declared that the pale green and emerald colors were the most beautiful, most soothing and most fascinating he had ever seen. The object left in the most classic way: first the whistling, then the elevation to an altitude of about 90 m and finally the ascent at a dizzying speed towards the northwest. The object gone, the man regained consciousness, and the happy, ecstatic feeling he had was replaced by sadness. It was as if time was passing very slowly... it was like being in another world he would later declare. He grabbed the phone and reported to his superiors what he had seen. At first, they thought it was a hallucination due to stress; however, a thorough investigation was carried out. The officers went to the scene, examined it minutely, without finding any physical evidence, re-interviewed the witness and, as he maintained that the event was real, they sent him to Paris for a more detailed examination. There, he stayed a week under observation at the Val-de-Grâce hospital. An electroencephalogram revealed nothing abnormal. The doctors concluded that he was in good mental and physical health and was not excessively suffering from the tension due to the war. (12:30)",

So we saw, at this distance, what seemed to be a large oblong and flattened object suspended between 30 and 45 m above the superstructure of the bridge crossing the lake. We slowed down and then decided to get closer and examine the object... When we arrived at 25 m from the bridge, the car completely let us down. It seemed to come from the electrical circuits; the dashboard and headlights went out, the engine stopped. Mr. S., who was driving, tightened the brakes \\(the engine no longer running\\) and maneuvered the key 1 or 2 times. The mill remained silent; so then we really started to be afraid... We contemplated it... for maybe 30 to 45 seconds and then, although I'm not sure of the order of events, it seemed to emit a very bright white light beam, and both of us felt the heat on our face... At the same time, we heard a fairly loud noise, which I took for a muffled explosion... And then, very quickly... the object started to go up vertically. As far as we could judge, it did not change position \\(aspect\\) during its ascent. The only difference is that it was very bright and its edges became unclear so that, as it climbed, its shape was no longer distinguishable. It disappeared in 5 to 10 seconds. We were really scared... It took us maybe 1/4 hour to get back to a telephone booth. (October 26, 10:30 PM)",

The policemen in radio liaison try to follow a nocturnal light that moves at low altitude, along various country roads, then the light stops near a large tree, in the middle of a cultivated field, and the policemen's cars arrive at a distance of less than 100 m from this tree. The witnesses observe for a long time with caution then try to approach on foot: It hovered above a large tree, which rose alone in the middle of a cultivated field. We were about 100 m from the tree, which was about 35 m high. The object, which subtended an angle of about 1/4 °, which implies a real diameter less than 0.90 m, appeared circular in shape and was therefore probably a spheroid. It was intensely bright against the dark background of the sky and it passed through all the colors of the spectrum with a fairly irregular period of about 2 s. Given its brightness, I may have slightly overestimated its angular dimension and 1/4 ° should perhaps be considered a maximum. The minimum estimate would certainly be 1/8 °. The object seemed to examine the tree quite closely. It described circles around the top, standing between 15 and 30 m from the ground, passing in front of the tree, then clearly visible through the branches when it passed behind. We watched it continue this apparent \"reconnaissance\" of the tree for several minutes. It moved deliberately and intentionally in its inspection of the tree, making short stops at points of interest and giving a distinct impression of intelligent behavior. Then, as we absolutely wanted to photograph it, we crossed the fence and slowly approached the tree, on the side facing West. We had barely gone 3 m when it \"noticed\" us and, with a powerful and silent acceleration, it left almost due south and disappeared over the horizon, with a slightly ascending trajectory, and 2.5 s approximately, without any noise. I believe that one can rely on my evaluation of distances and times because at the time I did a lot of athletics and was therefore well trained in this respect. Even taking into account the exceptional circumstances, these figures are probably accurate to within 20% (Summer, 2 h)",

The loggers of the region had seen nothing, heard nothing. A striking object seemed to have dug the cliff, the ice and the bottom of the lake, creating a 1000m^3^ pit swallowing the frozen ground, pushing the ice into the bottom and advancing 20m on the bottom pushing a 1.5m ridge of muddy earth and then coming out in reverse. The object was not seen but left fragments of many metals. The broken ice pieces were of an emerald green whose nature and origin no analysis could explain. Strange black grains collected on the shore revealed a metallic chemical composition so complex that it could only be obtained by operations at very high temperatures; they resisted the action of acids. It was concluded that these grains had a non-organic and probably non-natural origin. Since then, the vegetation inside the pit is inexplicably lush but, in spite of so many enigmas, the research was not pursued, because the phenomenon is not dangerous to man. (April 28th, 8am)",

Strangely, this skull would be pierced with a neat hole, without radial cracks, which would suggest the impact of a bullet. The same type of impact appears on a prehistoric bison skull dating from around 8000 to 10000 BC, which this time is preserved by the Paleontology Museum of Moscow. This fossil would have been found west of the Lena, a river that crosses the Autonomous Republic of Yakutia, famous for the countless mammoth tusks found buried in its frozen soil most of the year. You can see a photograph of this skull in Erich von Däniken's *Gods from Outer Space*. The latter, as well as Soviet scientists such as K. Flerov, claim that this hole is indeed from that time because its edges have been re-calcified, proof that the animal would have survived its injury. As the photograph is taken from far enough away to encompass the entire bison skull, it is impossible to detect this re-calcification. But one can indeed see a neat round hole at the forehead level.\" (August 27)",

The large white object moves towards the small one and appears to collide with it. Then the large object turns, stops wavering, and moves out of sight. According to the report of the astonished observers, the incident could be either an attack of the large object on the small one or a refueling or recharging operation. The observers' report will be examined by Dr. Paul Siple, scientific attaché of the US Embassy in Canberra, and two engineers from [NASA](https://web.archive.org/web/2005/http://rr0.org/NASA.html). They will conclude, first of all, that the observers indeed saw what they described. They will also conclude that the mysterious objects were not known or made on Earth devices.

This UFO then remained stationary at an estimated altitude of 900 m. Blackburn estimated its diameter to be greater than 60 m. As he watched, a smaller UFO, about 18 m in diameter, landed 15 m away from him. Its surface was polished like a mirror. At the top was a bell that gave Blackburn a rather strange impression when he observed it. An opening appeared on the side of the UFO, as if someone had taken a piece of pie out of it, and 3 humanoid figures emerged floating: their feet never touched the ground. They approached within 11 m of Blackburn and emitted various unintelligible sounds. They were about 1 m tall but, apart from this detail, they looked like ordinary humans. Blackburn, petrified, did not answer them and the beings returned floating to their craft. Then the two UFOs quickly left. There were no traces in the snow. Shortly after Blackburn's story was published in the local newspaper, the *Waynesboro News-Virginian*, a car with federal license plates appeared in town: the inhabitants said it was visible as the nose on the face. Blackburn was apparently severely warned by government agents \\(belonging to an agency he did not want to cite\\) not to say anything more about his experience. (18:15)",

They looked like a blue, vaporous cloud that, for sure, made a shrill noise when flying away. The ornithologist of the Australian Museum, H. J.

I turned West onto Highway 70. 400 meters further on, I changed my mind and thought it was a prefabricated house coming down the highway at an early hour. It was parked on the side of the road, I got to within a hundred meters, stopped, got out of the car and walked towards the object leaving my headlights on and my engine running. I took about 15 steps and then remembered I had a Kodak on the front seat and wanted to take a picture. I hesitated for a second and then saw the man dressed in military fatigues. I thought it was a sergeant... he had the insignia on his right arm and some kind of cap with the visor up. He weighed about 80 kg and was about 1.70 m tall. He was just a regular G.I. mechanic in civilian clothes... or a crew chief or something like that. He had a flashlight in his hand and was almost kneeling on his right knee, his left hand touching the bottom of the fuselage. The object looked like an aluminum airliner without wings or tail, and without seams along the fuselage. It rose vertically, about 1.50 m, then headed southeast, almost backwards, at about 1200 km/h judging by the barns it lit up as it flew along the valley. It was the size of a cargo plane but had no visible propulsion device. The witness was bombarded with questions by officers from the air base. A truck driver had observed the same object on the road.

But I had never seen lights like that, nor anything similar! It was not just lights, it was fires! The objects cross the fields. The old woman gets scared: All these fires, I'm too old, I don't want to see things like that. If things start moving like this, what are we all going to become? After that it moved again, in the corner of the vineyard, you remember , that's when I called you, that's when I was scared, but if it gets closer, it will go into the barn and everything will go up in smoke, the house and us with it. So I called him, I called him. The son-in-law, who ran the farm and had seen the same thing as the old woman, goes out to check on the spot: The objects were rounded on top and rather flattened underneath; they vanished on the spot as if they were controlled by a switch. At one point there were 6, less than 2 km away; they moved in line at the speed of a tractor, then merged into a large luminous object resembling a flaming tree, an illuminated shell. Everything disappeared. The witnesses returned, completely amazed. The whole phenomenon took place without a sound. Later she will go to bed dressed for fear of \"what could happen\". (June 15)",

As it gets close to the observers, it slows down and then stops, remaining stationary over the base at an altitude between 90 and 150 m, illuminating the entire valley. At this point, all the machines and power systems of the base stop working, as do those of the tanker in the bay and some Diesels.

The two victims were Miguel José Viana, 34 years old, and Manuel Pereira da Cruz, 32 years old, both electronics technicians and specialists in television. Both married, they lived in the city of Campos where they were well known. The analyses will show that the blood found near the dead was not theirs, and the autopsy could not determine the cause of their death. Inspector Bittencourt is categorical on this subject: Our specialists have excluded the possibility of poisoning, an act of violence or death by asphyxiation. According to a forensic doctor, the death, which dated back to August 16 or 17, was natural \\(heart attack\\). Inspector Bittencourt did not make the link between this double death and the UFO, nor even with any scientific experiment that had gone wrong. It was for him a staging organized by the murderer or murderers in order to conceal a theft - it is said that the victims had left home with a very large sum of money in cash.

Only the eldest daughter stayed with a friend. They were watching television in the afternoon when it suddenly went out. The house was lit up by a strange, red and yellow light, which seemed to spin around. The girls looked outside and saw an object hovering in the same place, near the same tree, as in the first event. Its shape was still that of an overturned bowl on a flat circle, like a saucer. It was bathed in light and took off shortly afterwards. There was no sign of life inside or outside the craft.

They try to get closer: The object remained suspended, motionless, for about 15 minutes, extinguishing when we directed our spotlights on it. It was the size of a dollar coin held at arm's length. Shortly after, a smaller object - a light - streaked across the sky and also stopped next to the large light. Then the big light described a square trajectory, sending blue light beams to the ground from time to time. After maneuvering like this for about 1/2 hour, the lights shot off at full speed in the direction from which they came and disappeared in about 5 seconds. And all this absolutely silently.

He decides to go behind the thing to see what it was, having already assumed that there was one in front and one behind; but when he passes the door, the sphere is just there waiting for him, while it was still in the courtyard a moment earlier. The man then decides to take a small path through the fields to go around the object but the sphere follows him for 60 m before blocking the entrance of the path: This thing followed me for about 60 m, quite close to me... so there was a small path where I wanted to pass... to go around it from behind, then it followed me all the way... until I stopped there where I wanted to go around it, and the \"machine\" stops too, just at the entrance of the path. So I said, there, there's no arguing, I can't pass! The farmer then calls his son and both of them see 6 spheres that scare them so much that they immediately go back into the house. The large oblong object is also there and it emits a beam similar to that of a lighthouse: There was a lighthouse above, just at the end, to the right, and it was lighting up this window up there, it was lighting up the whole room... I had the window open in front. - Was it a diffuse beam, or rather concentrated? - Oh, concentrated, very concentrated. - And it was lighting up your room? - Yes, it was lighting up it... going and coming... it was turning... it was always turning. - Was it turning in a circle, like a lighthouse? - Yes, sometimes it was lighting up the window below... it kept turning in a circle... but it was there, at 11 PM already, maybe 11:15 or something like that.

Immediately, 2 MIG-21 fighters were sent to intercept the intruder. The 2 pilots soon discovered a shiny metal sphere devoid of any identification marks. After exhausting radio contact attempts, the Cuban Air Defense Headquarters ordered the mission leader to destroy the UFO. He then confirmed that the target was being tracked by his firing radar and that he had armed his missiles. These were his last words. A few seconds later, the other pilot began to scream into his microphone that the MIG-21 had exploded, or rather, he specified a moment later, had suddenly disintegrated without fire or smoke. The Americans of Boca Chica Key then heard the Cuban radar controllers announce that, following an incredible acceleration, the UFO had suddenly risen to nearly 30,000 m and had disappeared in the direction of South America. The [NSA](https://web.archive.org/web/2005/http://rr0.org/NSA.html) under the operational control of which the Air Force Security Service units are located then demanded that all documents related to the accident be sent to it within the hour and that it be immediately recorded in the surveillance unit's archives as due to a mechanical malfunction. The case remained secret until 1978, when one of the witnesses of Boca Chica Key --- whose anonymity is protected --- revealed it to [Stanton Friedman](https://web.archive.org/web/2005/http://rr0.org/FriedmanStanton.html).",

Cadillac is roughly halfway between Traverse City and Reed City, a distance of about 100 miles. The reports came three days after similar reports in Grand Haven on Lake Michigan and hours after a Northwestern University investigator left Michigan after examining the Grand Haven reports. \"I saw something, but I don't know what it was,\" said Cadillac patrolman Harry Hagstrom. Hagstrom said the object was bright white and appeared in a clear sky over Lake Cadillac. He said two other police officers verified the sighting. \"It seemed to change directions,\" Hagstrom said. \"Up, down, left, right and then it stayed stationary for a moment. It was bright white the first time I saw it, but the color faded to a duller white, then red, then green. It was a very clear night and all the stars were bright,\" he added, \"But I'm sure it wasn't a star. Other than that, I don't know what it was.\" [William T.

It was a terribly strong light. The roof of the car didn't even seem to be a shield. It's incredible, a light so intense. When I looked at my hands, it was like an X-ray photo.

The observed object first moved horizontally, then made a stationary flight with yo-yo movements, and finally a sudden final ascent. Excerpt from the policeman's account: I had to sit and watch it for 5 good minutes. It bounced like a ball that would jump to a musical rhythm, but when it left - bang - it disappeared in less than 5 seconds. It went straight up, without deviating... I thought it was guided by someone or something, because a balloon floating in the air would not move like that. (3 h)",

It is again a metal mass, located at 134 m deep and measuring about 8 m wide and 60 m long. This could be a submarine. Moreover, the mass was on the route of the *Minerve*. But, despite the searches undertaken, including with Commander Cousteau's diving saucer, nothing more is found than the carcass of a cargo ship. A little later still, a new echo is received by sonar and located 1.8 km northwest of the first, without anything being discovered. The searches last in all 5 days and occupy half of the total means of the French Navy in the Mediterranean. Rear Admiral Storelli, commander of the submarine forces, confirms that the French Navy has no new element and that it is in absolute ignorance of what could have happened, given the quality of the men, beyond reproach, and of the material. On the other hand, the *Minerve* had been checked as is done at each change of commander and it was in perfect condition.",

Excerpt from the air hostess's account: ...This thing came up from the bottom of the hill, very, very fast, and in a very uniform way, as if it was sliding, but it was lower than an airplane, and it came gliding to stop above this car \\[a car that had just passed the witness's\\]. Then its lights went out \\[those of the other car\\] and I stopped, thinking there was a young person driving. Since it had turned everything off, I didn't want to hit it. And meanwhile my headlights were dimming a bit, but I didn't pay attention until everything went out in my car: the engine, the headlights and the radio. That happened when it \\[the UFO\\] released that car to go back up the road... up above us. It had made a descent from the other car, and it was very low. When I wanted to look at it through the windshield I had to lean on the wheel and turn; I looked up and it was there, above us - and the car was completely stopped. I had opened the window of the door when the lights of the other car went out and it was still open, but I heard absolutely nothing. The object had a triangle shape, like those little triangles of dough that you roll to make croissants. It was orange-red, like the light on a beautiful St. Martin's summer, very colorful... When it was just above us, I tried to restart the car, I tried, I tried, but as long as that thing stayed above us I couldn't make it go, it wouldn't even turn 1/4 of a turn. I turned the key, and it went \"ouah\" and then nothing at all, it was like the battery was dead... When that thing was there, you heard absolutely nothing, not even the lively noise of nature, it was a strangely worrying calm. And then I remember that I had become light, airy, a bit like in an airplane when it goes down in an air pocket, I felt light as air, without gravity. Then it went down behind us, on my side, and it went to fly over a field near a farm that is there. It moved smoothly, without jerks. Finally, when it released the car, it left with a jolt. I turned the ignition key and the engine started, I was able to start the car, so I kept my foot on the accelerator and I arrived in Cochrane. I saw it passing over the railway and going away slowly. A good while after, my feet were still burning, when I got out of the car, it seemed to me that they were bathing in a source of dry heat. (April 3, 8:10 PM)",

Once inside, he was restrained and forced to wear a helmet. The machine took off and, after an interminable time, landed. Da Silva's eyes were blindfolded and he was taken to a brightly lit room, in which he saw the bodies of 4 other humans. He was then interrogated by 15 tiny creatures. They were hairy, with long red beards and hair of the same color, big noses, big ears and no teeth. They took his fishing gear, his ID card, and his banknotes. They asked him to be their guide among men. When he refused, he was brought back to Earth. (May 4th, 3pm)",

They decide to rest in a clearing and watch the stars rise as twilight falls. The two men hear a buzzing sound and see in the sky a very bright light approaching from the north. It turns around at the clearing level and descends towards them from the south. It is surrounded by a red-gray luminous mist. When the cloud has descended to about 15 m from the ground, they see in its center a disc of about 3 m in diameter. The disc stays at this height, continuing to buzz. Then, according to Heinonen: The immense disc began to descend with the red-gray mist, which became thinner and transparent. It stopped at a height of 3 or 4 m, so close that I could touch it with my ski stick. We saw that its upper part was topped with a dome. Along the lower edge was a kind of raised part with 3 spheres with domes spaced at equal distances. From the center of its lower part protruded a tube about 25 cm in diameter, from which suddenly came an intense beam of light. I suddenly felt as if someone had pulled me back. At the same second, I saw the creature. It stood in the middle of the light beam, with a black box in its hands. It was about 90 cm tall, with very thin arms and legs. Its face was like pale wax. The nose looked more like a hook than a nose. The ears were very small and narrowed at the face. The creature wore a kind of suit in a light green material and a shiny conical helmet like metal. The being points the black box at Heinonen, and a blinding, flickering yellow light takes him as a target. A red mist begins to cover the area and red, green and purple sparks begin to rain around the skiers like candles about 10 cm long floating in long curves. The mist becomes thicker and thicker, until, according to Viljo, the beam suddenly began to decrease, rose like a flickering flame and was sucked into the opening of the craft. Then it was as if the veil of mist had dissolved. The air around us was empty! After a few minutes, Heinonen realizes that he can no longer use his left leg, the one that was most exposed to the strange light beam. Viljo supports his friend to his home, about 3 km further. In the months that followed, Heinonen suffered from severe memory loss, constant pain, exhaustion and headaches. For 2 months, his urine was like black coffee. Viljo suffered from facial swelling, headaches and eye problems. (January 7th, 4:45 PM)",

Surprised, and a bit scared, I braked. It took me about 200 m to stop. We opened the doors, ready to flee, because during those few seconds, a luminous sphere had appeared, rising slowly from the ravine. It seemed to have a diameter of about thirty meters. It seemed to us that it was heading towards us. We ran away, leaving the car. But we quickly realized that the thing was not pursuing us. At very low altitude, it had started to fly over the side of the valley, very slowly, sometimes stopping. It lit up the ground over a radius of 300 m. A firework light. A bit unreal. It was something wonderful and terrifying at the same time. We were so captivated by the show that we didn't see the time pass. We suddenly realized that we had been there for more than 1 hour. \"We can't stay like this,\" said Jean-Claude. \"Tomorrow, when we tell this, we'll be called 'illuminates'. We need a witness.\" We got back in the car, but taking the road that follows the opposite slope to the one that is flown over by the \"thing\". When we arrived at the hamlet of Feouzet, we discovered the valley again. The huge luminous sphere was still there. Fascinated, we looked at it again for long minutes. Then we rushed to wake up the deputy mayor, Eugène Payot. He recounts: When Bernard and Jean-Claude came to wake me up, they were so excited that I had a hard time understanding what they were saying. Yet I got up and went out to look. It was more beautiful than I could imagine, this kind of disk hovering, motionless, above the valley. I have no words to describe it. We couldn't take our eyes off it and we fought against sleep to observe it as long as possible. (February 12)",

And during these 5 hours, Saint-Pierreville experienced an inexplicable power outage. The police and the mayor confirmed it to me. A curious outage, since, if the light bulbs refused to turn on, the electric radiators and the clock of the bell tower continued to work. A technician will say: It was an electromagnetic phenomenon, that is why only the devices in a closed circuit continued to work. (February 13th, 6am)",

They looked like large elongated insects, as if wrapped in a dark plastic armor, and stood upright on their rather arched hind legs. Their two pairs of front legs were used to grasp.

He supports his claims with a photograph of the cube, showing that it is far from being as artificially-appearing as it had been proclaimed. He finally indicates that an analysis carried out in 1986 \\(1886?\\) at the Vienna Natural History Museum had established that the object was simply a mass of cast iron.

At this moment the witness trembles and can no longer hold his weapon, let alone use it effectively, but he shouts that he will shoot if the beings come any closer. At the same time, the man was telling his wife what was happening. She didn't want to answer until she heard that the creatures were leaving.

It was moving north towards Rabasten while getting closer to my car. \\(...\\) This ball was for a moment facing my vehicle. \\(...\\) At that moment, it took on a more oval shape, like a rugby ball. This ball was so bright, in front and around me, that I could see as if it were broad daylight. While it was at the height of my car, it no longer pulled, it had misfires, it did not move despite my acceleration - and this over a distance of at least fifty meters. When this ball so to speak turned in front of me on the national 21 \\(N 21\\), it had lost some altitude while still keeping the same color, but this ball was becoming bigger and bigger, that is to say it must have reached 2 m in diameter. I did not hear any noise \\(...\\). I was very scared. \\(...\\) I add that \\(...\\) I saw a second one, smaller, of a bright red. It was roughly at the same height as the first one. From these balls came a very powerful light and rays that blinded me. Mr. D.'s eyes will be red and tearful for 2 days. Several witnesses saw that night in the region powerful lights or luminous balls. (0 h 45)",

The headlights go out completely, and Peter loses all control of the vehicle, which speeds down the road at 145 km/h. When Fort Victoria comes into view, the UFO veers off and moves away; the car then starts functioning normally again. The couple stops at Fort Victoria to get gas and astonishes the attendant by making remarks about the cold.

Even stranger, the road becomes totally straight and without traffic, crossing lush tropical vegetation \\(when it is known to be winding and heavily trafficked at night, crossing arid landscapes\\).

He lay in a critical state between life and death, enduring terrible suffering. The father and mother of this person were at my parents' house that evening, expressing their faith in God as to the outcome of this misfortune. This pitiful scene, of this father and this mother, confronted with this terrible accident, had truly moved me. The atmosphere becoming unbearable, I decided to take my friend home. All along the way, an inner tearing weighed on me more and more. Was reality only the result of random events, without order or purpose, where human existence would be fortuitous and without finality? Faced with this existential anguish, from the depths of my being, while looking at the starry sky, a question arose: if there is an order, a purpose, something that guides creation, making us something other than miserable beasts, give me a sign? \\(In short, the kind of question we all ask ourselves at least once in our lives\\). As incredible as it may seem, as soon as I finished my request, a luminous disc, or a globe, of a size larger than the full [Moon](https://web.archive.org/web/2005/http://rr0.org/Moon.html), crossed a good portion of the sky \\(about 60° on an arc of 180°\\), in just 2 to 3 s. The disc seemed to be at about the same altitude as that taken by commercial transport airliners, about 10,000 m. These details give the object a considerable size and speed. I quickly alerted my friend so that she could look at this disc, of pale phosphorescent green color, crossing the zenith at a phenomenal speed. She had just enough time to see it disappear, leaving behind a trail of multicolored particles. This myriad of particles persisted for about a minute after the disappearance of the object, giving us the opportunity to observe attentively the trail of multicolored points slowly fading. We were both stunned, as you can imagine. The surprise was even greater for me, since the manifestation answered the expression of a sincere desire! (Summer evening)",

It stops above a group of 3 people: 2 old women, Anita and Geralda, and an illiterate farmer of 30 years old, Cicilio Higinio Pereira. Terrorized, the trio flees. One of the farmer's sandals tears, so he kneels down to try to repair it because the stones of the path hurt his foot. Suddenly \\(he will later tell the ufologist Hulvio Alexio\\) the object is above him. It looks like a huge open umbrella. The light it emits becomes so intense that the smallest detail of the ground becomes visible. The UFO descends and the farmer has the impression that he would just have to raise his arm to touch it. Imploring God and his saints, Cicilio rolls on the ground in the hope of escaping the luminous apparition. But it follows him and he feels momentarily lifted off the ground. A cold wind accompanied by a buzzing and a smell of sulfur envelops him. The UFO still hovers for a moment, enough time for Cicilio to glimpse inside - through a \"door\" that briefly opens - 2 or 3 silhouettes of a little more than 1 m tall. Then, in a few seconds, the UFO disappears. Getting up as best he can, Cicilio goes home, dazed and shaken by nausea. He spends the rest of the night vomiting. From that day on, the illness never leaves him. Unable to do anything, he mostly stays in bed, prey to extreme weakness and deep apathy. A little more than 2 months after his encounter with the UFO - which he nicknamed, for an obscure reason, \"the train\" - and despite a brief remission of the illness, he dies. His family immediately burns the body, as no doctor practices in the area. In the absence of an autopsy, it is therefore impossible to determine the cause of death. However, exhaustion and vomiting suggest the action of a fatal radiation for the man. (August 9th, 8 PM)",

Some of them have a strong orange-red light in the middle, clearly visible, sending out flashes. Others, circular, give the impression of being adorned on their periphery with a concentric ramp with a good number of lights: these are white or yellowish. They get lost in the infinite. None of them change shape or color. These UFOs move making very disordered movements, ascending or descending, rotary or spiroid, at lightning speeds. They stabilize, restart abruptly... They disappear or reappear suddenly during their evolutions. During the entire observation made by the military of the [gendarmerie](https://web.archive.org/web/2005/http://rr0.org/Gendarmerie.html), no sound of engine or reactor is heard from these UFOs and we do not notice any trace of their passage.

None of the 3 men can see beyond the hood of their truck. All outside noise ceases. The CBs stop working and the truck engines start to fail. Then, the blue light - described by a nearby car driver as a kind of bright blue lampshade above the 3 trucks - disappears and everything suddenly returns to normal. The last trucker in line yells into his CB: Hey, UFO, if you hear me, I want to go with you! The blue light returns, for about 15 seconds, and causes the same effects as before; the speed of the trucks drops to 8 km/h. When the light disappears again, everything returns to normal.

A few months earlier, a house near the store had been inexplicably bombarded with stones. Gradually, the image shrinks until it becomes unreadable. They turn off the television and plug in a record player but it runs slow for no reason. Convinced that the electrical network is suffering from a voltage drop, they turn on a small portable radio: the broadcasts are inaudible. They hear noises of objects falling in the store. Thinking of thieves, Carbajal and Ledesma put their disabled friend in safety outside the house, then open the door of the store. Jars of mayonnaise and a bottle of wine are broken on the floor. A scale has also fallen, glass broken. 6 m away from them are 2 beings of human appearance but of small size, dressed in tight-fitting suits, observing them with a threatening attitude. One of the two takes a box filled with cigarette cartridges from a counter and throws it towards the witnesses. Then one of the beings raises a hand to his face: when his index finger comes into contact with his nose, the two entities vanish into the air. (Sunday, September 10)",

Having come with his fishing net in the hope of improving his daily fare, he was taking advantage of the moonlight. Suddenly, a beam of red light falling from the sky hits him and makes him shiver. Looking up, he discovers that it comes from a round and violet object floating in the air. Terrified, Chico Gama runs to hide in the nearest thicket. The object follows him, touching him intermittently with its red beam. This game of cat and mouse lasts 3 hours. Unable to escape the red beam and the buzzing emitted by his pursuer, Chico Gama spends a night of terror, convinced that, tired of playing, the object will eventually kill him with its beam. 5 AM: At dawn, the object suddenly stops its pursuit and evaporates into the sky, leaving the man exhausted and close to fainting. He nevertheless manages to get home and hides for hours under his bed before telling his family what happened to him. Two days later, he falls ill. The skin on his arms and back peels off like after a sunburn, he suffers from migraines and sweats continuously for a good month. Bop Pratt, who would meet Chico Gama in 1986, five years later, will tell of having seen a nervous and fearful man, who still sometimes hides under his bed. His daughters will tell him that he no longer goes out at night and that sometimes he is afraid to stay alone in broad daylight. (2 h)",

And rest assured that we check what's happening in the sky before concluding to an unidentified object. *Question*: What do you mean by that? *Operator*: The same as you: an Unidentified Flying Object, UFO for short. Just like any plane, the UFO is visible on the radar. *Question* **:** What happens then? *Operator*: Nothing, I'm looking at the type next to me. He looks back at me and glances at my screen. He looks back at me again. We look at the supervisor... *Supervisor*: And I'm watching my two operators. I'm looking at the screen, and I'm not saying anything. I'm waiting for the hypothetical target to disappear. Sometimes, it seems to stay indefinitely. *Question* **:** What does that mean...? *Supervisor*: Several hours. Up to ten hours. It's long, very long, like when you're waiting for a shell to explode. I know it's definitely a UFO. No mistake possible. But I'm not saying anything. *Operator*: He says nothing. Nobody says anything. We all know it's a UFO, but officially, it doesn't exist. *Supervisor*: We don't talk about these things. It's pointless. *Question* **:** But are you talking to a journalist?*Supervisor* : Even if we don't know what it is, it needs to be known. *Question* : If the UFO intrudes, how long before you alert your superior? *Supervisor* : If it is stationary, near the base. After 3 minutes. *Question* : Should we send out the hunt, a patrol? *Supervisor* : Sometimes 2 reconnaissance planes: one to film it, the second to film its friend and the UFO. *Question* : What becomes of these films? *Supervisor* : Nothing. They are classified as top secret. So they don't exist... (May 4)",

It is parked on the side of the highway. Sean Knowles, the driver, does not realize until the last moment that this light is illuminating another vehicle. He swerves violently to avoid the accident and then turns around to see what is happening. The light moves above the road, pursued by Knowles' vehicle. Then it starts to back up towards the car. Sean turns around again, but the UFO catches up with them. Something lands on the roof of the car with a dull thud and the vehicle seems to leave the ground. Fay Knowles lowers the window and sticks her hand out to touch the object above. She claims it was hot and spongy, and compares it to a rubber plunger used to unclog sinks. Meanwhile, chaos reigns in the car. A shrill sound is heard. One of the sons will later say he thought his brain was going to come out of his head. Sean, the driver, faints briefly. The dogs become wildly furious. Dust, entering through the lowered window, swirls inside and there is a smell of decomposing corpses. Then the UFO releases the car. It falls violently to the ground and one of the tires bursts. Sean takes control of it, stops it, and the whole family gets out to hide on the side of the road until the UFO moves away.  The UFO is about the same size as the car, white with a yellow center. It emits a kind of electric buzz. When it is gone, one of the strangest consequences of the experience occurs: for about 15 minutes, everyone's voice becomes very high-pitched, as if they had breathed helium. In this state, the family changes the wheel and then sets off towards Mundrabilla. The car is covered with a deposit similar to soot. The suitcases loaded on the gallery have disappeared. At the Manor Hotel in Mundrabilla, where the family takes refuge about 40 km away, a truck driver named Graham Henley tells them he saw a light in the distance and saw it hovering above their Ford. He can see that a smell of Bakelite permeates the car and that its roof is strangely bulged in 4 places. A little later, the Knowleses present themselves at the Ceduna police station. This is what Sergeant Fred Longlet will say about them: These people had really seen something. What exactly ... well, I don't know. They were in a frightening state, even 5 hours after the incident. Returned ... you can even say pale .. and trembling. The woman thanked heaven for being alive. These people were in a state 1000 times worse than all those who had reported UFO sightings to me so far. Something had happened. Their car, after all those miles traveled, was still covered with black ash or dust. There was even some inside. Where could it come from? Out there, there is nothing but sand. (1 h 45)",

As an ensign, I was the captain and occupied the right seat. The copilot, on the left, was driving the machine. We were flying at nearly 400 km/h. There was a sea of clouds below but the sky was beautiful, a superb twilight with blue and orange towards the West. And suddenly, between Montélimar and Moulins, we saw a big, bright, golden white light facing North, like a powerful torch that seemed suspended, stationary. I then said to my copilot: \"Hey, did you see that?\" \"Yeah! What is it? An airplane?\" I was certain: \"It's shining so much, it's not possible!\" and I decided to call the control: \"There's a point, something that's shining very brightly... Do you see anything in our North sector?\" The controller told me he didn't see anything. Then an Air Inter captain announced on the radio, in a very sure voice: \"No, it's an airplane!\" I replied: \"No, it's not possible, that's not it...\" Nobody answered. And then suddenly, after a minute, it seemed to go down and the phenomenon disappeared. On our return, the \"pacha\" of our squadron didn't want to hear anything. We weren't taken seriously at all.

      "desc": "\\(Translated from French\\) In the Puerto Montt zone \\(southern tip of South America\\), on a clear and cloudless night, the ACC \\(air traffic control center\\) heard the crew of the Chilean civil flight 045 asking them: Puerto Montt! Is there any traffic in front of us currently? The controller of the permanent tower leans out the window that looks north of the operational building and then notices something curious. He recounts: I saw a white light moving from the north to the airport. I was on the 3rd floor, where the ACC is located. At first, I confused it with the lights of the LAN 737, but when I checked the position of the aircraft, I realized that this light could not correspond to the Boeing 737 and that it was something else. I estimate that I started to see the light above Osorno, as it approached the airport. About 10 km from the runway, I was able to distinguish the object in question a little better. There were several white lights in the upper part and 4 red lights in the lower part. This object then approached about 1500 m from my position, always to the north. It never got closer... The object stopped for a few seconds and I could observe that, from the lower part, bright flashes of light were coming out, giving me the impression that this lower part was flat and of a metallic appearance. I estimate that its shape was circular and of a diameter of about 60 m. I could see the base of the object because of the flashes, but I could not see the upper part, except for these white lights mentioned previously. The flashes were quite different from the 4 lower red lights and did not twinkle. Then, after about 2 minutes, this strange object moved away to the north, in the same direction it had come from. I did not see it turn. Shortly afterwards, I lost sight of it towards the north, after following it with my eyes until the Osorno sector. The northward movement of the mysterious intruder in the direction from which flight 045 was approaching will first cause an anxious call from the captain and then, secondly, an \"air miss\" maneuver. The controller of the permanent tower then hears cries from the floor below, from where the phenomenon can be followed even more easily. At 0 h 10 UTC, while we were in radio communication with LAN flight 045 in the approach phase, concerning the existence of an unknown traffic that was in front of him, I could see from the tower a light similar to a star, but very large and without a specific shape, approximately aligned on the axis of the runway, about 16 km north and 40° above the horizon line, of great intensity and with changes of colors, passing successively from red to green and yellow. To try to see details of the object, I took the binoculars of the tower to better look at the UFO, but I could not see anything more, except a slow movement towards the south, that is to say towards the airport. This lasted 3 to 4 minutes, then the mysterious object seemed to be instantly \"sucked\" in the direction of the north, in the same way and as quickly as when one acts on the wheel of a zoom of a pair of binoculars to appreciate something from a greater distance. Having lost the visual contact of this object in the field of vision of my binoculars, I then looked for it with the naked eye at the same time as I heard the pilot of the LAN flight 045, on the ACC frequency, reporting that he had to make a left turn to avoid collision with the UFO... Looking north, on the horizon, I could only see a glow similar to a landing light reflecting in a nebula before disappearing. 5 minutes later, the Boeing of the LAN flight 045 made itself known on the tower frequency, about 25 km north of the runway, beginning its approach procedure, then it lit its landing lights which appeared very small on the horizon. Then everything went normally. The magnetic tape containing the conversations between the plane and the services of the air traffic control of Puerto Montt allowed to reconstitute with exactitude, and in real time this affair. The voice of the pilot at the controls of the Boeing was very stressed when he warned of the danger located right on his flight trajectory. This tape is the only report. He did not want to testify or establish an official report. (Wednesday, June 1st)",

He stops and quickly changes the tire. He is about to get back in the car when he notices a solitary figure running across a nearby field in his direction. Surprised to see someone at this late hour, Davis carefully observes the silhouette and, as the stranger approaches him, he is horrified to find out that he is not dealing with a human being. In fact, it is something the teenager has never seen before. The being is 2 meters tall, looks like a giant green and scaly lizard with red and shiny almond-shaped eyes. Apparently, it has only 3 fingers and 3 toes, each ending with a 10 cm black claw. Paralyzed, Davis eventually jumps into his car. In the meantime, the creature has reached the vehicle and started to fight with the outside rearview mirror as if it wanted to open the driver's door. The lizard-man is so excited that when Davis accelerates to escape its grip, it jumps onto the car roof and clings to it, while the terrified teenager drives at almost 120 km/h through the marshlands. The creature eventually lets go, falls off the roof and finally disappears in the distance \\[*Houston Chronicle* July-August\\]. Davis returns home to his parents terrified that night. He is hysterical, crying and trembling. When he calms down, he tells them what happened. The county sheriff, Liston Truesdale, also believes Davis' story and says He's a good, honest boy. He even agreed to take a lie detector test and be interrogated under hypnosis. No doubt: he is telling the truth. Several similar testimonies are reported to the police in the following weeks, attracting the attention of the media. The Scape Ore Marsh is invaded by television teams fighting for the best shooting locations; a local radio station even offers a $1 million reward for the capture of the famous \"lizard-man\". Several 3-fingered 35 cm long footprints are later discovered in the marsh. Plaster casts are made of them. (June 25th, 2am)",

      "desc": "\\(Translated from French\\) The naked and horribly mutilated body of a man of about 40 years old was found near the artificial lake of Guarapiranga. He was identified, but his family asked for his anonymity to be preserved. The case was not made public and added to the pile of unsolved crimes of the Brazilian police. In 1994, the ufologist Encarnacion Garcia, who had been investigating cattle mutilations in Brazil for a long time, learned by chance that Doctor Rubens Goes, one of his friends, was in possession of 7 strange photographs that he had received from Rubens Sergio, his cousin, a technician of the police services. The similarities between the wounds inflicted on the man of the Guarapiranga lake and those of the cattle dismembered by the ghost mutilators jumped to the eyes of the ufologist. Doctor Cuenca, who had conducted the examinations at the time, agreed to give him his file. In addition to the autopsy report, this file contained the police report which specified that the victim seemed to have not struggled nor been tied up. Although found between 48 and 72 hours after death, the body showed no signs of putrefaction or attacks by predators and did not emit any smell - a surprising detail in a hot climate like that of Brazil. The cheeks and lips had been precisely cut, the tongue sectioned, the eyes and ears - including the inner part - removed. The absence of any trace of blood seemed to indicate that an instrument cauterizing by heat, such as a laser, had been used. Circular perforations made with a punch, with a diameter varying between 3 and 4.5 cm, were visible under the arms, shoulders and legs. A neat hole of 4.5 cm was visible at the navel and the scrotum had been cut following an elliptical incision of 3.5 cm by 1.5. The testicles had been extracted with the same surgical precision. On the other hand, the penis was still in place but strangely distended. As for the anus, it had been excised following a large ellipse of 8.5 cm by 17 cm. It was also noted that almost all the internal organs had been removed, probably extracted through the perforations. Everything seemed to suggest that the victim had undergone a monstrous surgical operation for which he had been prepared, as suggested by the neatly shaved pubis. The similarities with cattle mutilations are striking: same precise technique, same organs cut and extracted with the same skill and same contempt for the corpse, thrown away after the operation like a mere debris.",

      "desc": "\\(Translated from French\\) Above the area between the small towns of Lajas and Cabo Rojo \\(Southwest of the island of Puerto Rico, between Santo Domingo and the Virgin Islands\\), a large triangular UFO appears. Wilson Rosa, a ufologist living in the municipality of Betances, testifies, as well as his wife and children: From 6 pm, we saw fighter jets flying over the region. At 19:45, we heard other planes belonging either to the Puerto Rico National Guard or to the US Navy. They flew very high, but we could clearly hear their engines. I followed their flight with attention because, about a week earlier, another one of these jets, an F-14 or an F-15, had pursued a UFO --- of small size --- above the Sierra Bermeja and the Laguna Cartagena. So I went out to observe them, and that's when I discovered a large UFO flying over the Sierra Bermeja.<br/><br/>It was huge! It blinked and had many colored lights. I ran to get my binoculars and I could clearly see that it had the shape of a triangle and was slightly rounded towards the back. It turned, returned to a lower altitude and seemed even bigger.<br/><br/>That's when we noticed 2 jet fighters flying just behind it. As the UFO moved away \\(towards the West\\), one of the planes tried to intercept it by passing in front of it. The UFO turned to the left and made a U-turn, reducing its speed. For 3 times, the planes tried to intercept it: the UFO slowed down even more and almost stopped. It was incredible!<br/><br/>That something so big could remain almost motionless was inconceivable. According to its size, it must have been extremely heavy. The second fighter stayed to the right of the UFO and the other one placed itself to its left towards the back. That's when.. I'm unable to say what exactly happened.<br/><br/>I don't know if the plane entered the UFO from the back or from the top. We all started to shout, fearing a collision, or even an explosion. The fighter placed in the back had disappeared inside the UFO because, in my binoculars, I didn't see it reappear neither towards the back, nor towards the top nor towards any other point.<br/><br/>The second plane stayed on the right of the UFO, very close. It seemed tiny compared to this huge machine. When the UFO took the direction of the West, the plane disappeared, as well as the sound of its engine. That's exactly what had happened when the first one had seemed to disappear inside the UFO. After having \"swallowed\" the planes, the UFO lost altitude and approached very close to the ground \\(above the small lake of Samàn\\). It stayed in the air for a moment, then its angles deformed and a big luminous flash jallited from the central yellow light ball. Then, it split in two triangular parts in the middle. It was incredible! The right triangle was now illuminated in yellow and the other one in red. The 2 triangles started to fly at full speed, one towards the southeast and the other one towards the northeast, towards Monte del Estado. When the UFO split, we could see some kind of red sparks coming off it. \\(See *US Jets Abducted at Puerto Rico*, The UFO Report, under the direction of Timothy Good.\\) <br/><br/>Another witness, Ivan Coté, added that it had seemed to him to see small red machines surrounding the UFO and trying to move away the planes. He specified that a 3rd fighter had turned back when it had seen what was happening to the others and that the red triangle had pursued it for a moment. The ufologist Jorge Martin didn't stop at collecting Wilson Rosa's testimony. He found in the region numerous witnesses whose stories overlap even in the details. In order to know more, Jorge Martin hastened to contact the competent authorities.<br/><br/>The [FAA](https://web.archive.org/web/2005/http://rr0.org/FAA.html) office for Puerto Rico replied to him that it had had no knowledge of any incident with a UFO, but that it knew that forces coming from the naval base of Roosevelt Roads, on the other side of the island, had accomplished military maneuvers in the zone in question --- which the said base denied afterwards. As for the air bases of the Puerto Rico National Guard of Muniz and Salinas, they were even less explicit and affirmed that none of their planes had flown over the region that evening. However, this beautiful unanimity cracked when Jorge Martin set out to interrogate the responsible units of the police specialized in the chase of drug traffickers and their planes, the *Fast Action United Force* \\(FURA\\), of which a radar unit was based in San German, very close to Cabo Rojo, as well as the *Criminal Investigation Corps*. He then learned that an intense activity of combat planes had been registered at the said hour above the region. Recontacted, the [FAA](https://web.archive.org/web/2005/http://rr0.org/FAA.html) said not to understand why Roosevelt Roads had denied the evidence and Mirabal, the officer interrogated by Jorge Martin, made him this surprising confidence: I know nothing about this incident, but even if it was the case, as soon as there is a report concerning UFOs, we are not allowed to investigate because these investigations are reserved to a special department of the [FAA](https://web.archive.org/web/2005/http://rr0.org/FAA.html) based in Washington, DC.. There was thus a special department at the [FAA](https://web.archive.org/web/2005/http://rr0.org/FAA.html) to study a phenomenon which officially didn't exist. (18 h)",

It shone very brightly, with green and red lights. This object gained a great speed. It accelerated and stopped abruptly, jumped up or down. Then a second one appeared, then a third. One of these objects stopped at a low altitude and remained motionless during my observation. The second object was lost. Only one remained. It moved along the horizon. I had the impression that sometimes it descended to the ground. Then it went up again and flew again. After that, an airplane appeared. It could be identified by its noise. It approached the object. But the object detached itself from it so quickly that one could have thought that the airplane was still in the same place. The airplane passed by and left. The object resumed its flight along the horizon. (July 28)",

The craft, bearing the symbol of the Ummites, lands on four legs in the middle of the park. Two creatures emerge. A giant \\(3-4m tall\\) with three eyes, and a headless dwarf \\(the children thought it was a robot\\). The large entity stares at a screaming child, makes him disappear by pointing a tube at him, and re-boards the craft. The UFO takes off. Immediately, the child \"re-materializes\". This event makes even more noise as the children claim to have witnessed multiple UFO landings with strange visitors. According to rumors that spread around the world, a high level of radioactivity is detected at the site, along with a \"extraterrestrial\" rock fragment; experts estimated the traces of the landing to the pressure of an object of more than 10 tons. Voronej becomes a hot spot for ufology tourism. The head of the geophysics laboratory travels with an investigation commission \\(scientists including nuclear physicist S. Kadmenski, criminologists, doctors, meteorologists and ufologists\\) created by the local Party committee. The commission concludes that there is no proof of a landing: After radiometric and spectrochemical analyses, examinations of the soil and microorganisms, we found no anomalies in the soil or vegetation. The trace of the UFO existed before the alleged landing date. It can still be visited. (September 27th, 6:30 PM)",

They reach the height of Grosse Weide, between Kettenis and Merols. The driver of the car, v. M., is surprised by the presence of a very intense light spot to the right of the road. There is only a meadow and no reason to find such a powerful lighting as that of a football stadium. The light spot covers an area whose center is located about 50 m from the road and extends up to 20 m from it. One could read the gazette. Gendarme v. M. slows down and indicates this unexpected light spot to his colleague, saying: Look, why is this meadow so lit up? Gendarme N. is sitting on the side of the light. He lowers the window and sees a large platform, motionless in the sky. They are now driving very slowly and both observe the phenomenon. The other cars pass them, as if nothing was wrong. The underside of the platform is equipped with 3 huge headlights, pointing downwards. The contours of the headlights are circular and one can clearly distinguish the limits of the 3 white light cones that emerge from them and extend to the ground. The air is not humid. H. v. M. will evaluate the altitude of the object at about 120 m, by comparison with the telecommunications tower of the Eupen gendarmerie \\(74 m\\) and based on the angle of vision \\(68 °\\) and the position of the spot in the meadow. It is the silence of the engine that surprises the two gendarmes the most. They do not hear anything that exceeds the noise of the car and the road traffic, the window being lowered on the side of the engine, to the east of the road. So it is not a helicopter. Looking more closely, they clearly see the outlines of a large dark mass against the twilight sky. The headlights are dazzling, but the base seems to be perfectly flat. It is horizontal and forms an isosceles triangle, with a wide base. The adjacent corners to the base are cut. The gendarmes paid attention to the overall structure and not to any possible rounding of the angles. The tip of the triangle is oriented towards Eynatten. M. v. M. will specify dimensions of 6 m for the length of the nearest side, 30 to 35 m for the length of the base, 25 m for the height of the triangle and about 2 m for the thickness of the platform. The diameter of the white headlights is at least 1 m, but there is also a kind of red beacon in the center of the underside. The white headlights light up constantly and are located relatively close to the corners of the object. The flashing red light is less intense, but clearly visible. The frequency of the flashing is 1 to 2 times / s but this light does not go out completely. It looks like that of a beacon. The gendarmes continue to drive slowly, observing the engine with amazement and great attention. At this moment, the object starts to move, pointing forward. It moves parallel to the road, at about 50 km / h, in the same direction as the gendarmes. Mr. N. then says: Let's get on the small road a little further on, to look at it well. This is the path from Merols to Raeren. The object should fly over them at this point. (5:20 PM)",

In fact, despite the discovery of the *Deep See*, the exact position of the 5 bombers remains a mystery, because finally, the 5 planes spotted by the treasure hunters were not the Avengers of Flight 19. The site turned out to be an old exercise area, where planes had been regularly sunk between 1943 and 1945. The US Navy revealed that Lieutenant Taylor's aircraft bore the same serial number as an aircraft that had sunk in the waters of the Bermuda Triangle well before he undertook this mission. (June)",

The most spectacular of these objects appears near the top of the image, near the Earth's horizon. The enlarged image shows the object moving to the left before the screen is lit up by a burst of light. Then the object changes direction and accelerates. A few seconds later, another object passes in front of the camera and heads into space. Professor Jack Kasher of the University of Nebraska and a collaborator of [NASA](https://web.archive.org/web/2005/http://rr0.org/NASA.html) studied these sequences and produced a 105-page report. Conclusions: According to [NASA](https://web.archive.org/web/2005/http://rr0.org/NASA.html), they were ice crystals, which is physically impossible because ice crystals could not change direction in such a way. Our calculations show that if the objects were 16 km from the shuttle, the largest one accelerated from 0 to 4023 km/h in one second. (September 15)",

Control has forbidden us to pass through the military testing zone of Melun-Villaroche, and we know an AWACS plane is flying in the area.

It has no wings, no tail, no rudder, no cockpit, no air intake, nothing at all. At one point, it seems to tilt 10-20° to avoid us, but it's possible we were deceived by the perspective. As it passes a little below and to our left, I can make out what looks like 5 or 6 nozzles, all positioned at the back. Then 3 seconds pass before it disappears less than 330 meters below our Airbus. Fortunately, because I don't think we could have avoided it. I say to my copilot and my navigator mechanic: \"Guys...

We remain puzzled as to the cause of this incident. However, as even civilian vessels are staying away from the Lewis area, a large manoeuvre involving planes, boats and military submarines starts in the same place. Officially, it is only a coincidence, but according to a source from the Scottish National Party, fishermen reported having seen a frigate from the navy retrieving a wreck from the ocean floor. The army seems to have found something. 4 months later, in April 1997, an unidentified substance is washed up on the beach of Tangusdale, in Barra \\(Scotland\\). Regional experts confirmed that the prevailing currents and winds could have brought this substance - possibly a residue of an unknown fuel - from the Lewis area. (October 27th)",

At first he thinks it's a large owl, but as it flies directly in front of him he realizes it's a strange creature. As the creature flies near a nearby street lamp, the witness notices it's a humanoid shape with a very large head, no wings, and flying at a constant altitude, without making any noise. The body is about 1.4 m long. It seems to be covered in a dark green \"braided\" fur. It has a pear-shaped head, but the witness can't see its eyes. It has long thin arms. As the creature flies in front of the witness for about 10 m, he feels a cold sweat and an illogical panic. The creature flies next to the street lamp and makes a 90° turn, quickly disappearing from view. The street lights go out as the creature flies by and then turn back on later. (April 5th, 12:20 PM)",

One of the boys had a cell phone and noticed that it had turned on by itself and had dialed the number 1 several times. They also noticed that the light from the street lamp had dimmed.

Residents near the [Andrews AFB](https://web.archive.org/web/2005/http://rr0.org/AndrewsAFB.html) are woken up in the morning by unusual activity.

Shards of glass, broken dishes, then a dull rumble. For a moment, many believe it to be a major earthquake. But the dazzling flash that lit up the sky erases all doubts. The event was not terrestrial but celestial. Something had fallen from the sky. Immediately, all possibilities are considered. Journalist Evguénii Pouchkarev, from the local newspaper No. 1, quotes an anonymous military man who believes it may be the fall of a missile that has deviated from its nominal trajectory. The thesis of space debris is quickly discarded: Indeed, surveillance satellites detect and track on several orbits all objects resulting from the disintegration of a space vehicle, explains Fernand Alby, from [CNES](https://web.archive.org/web/2005/http://rr0.org/CNES.html). To validate the thesis of a meteorite, a fragment of meteorite must be found. The Americans, on the other hand, have determined with their satellites the point of impact and its energy, estimated at 0.2 kilotons of TNT.. (1 h 50)",
